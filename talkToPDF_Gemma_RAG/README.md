**Talk to your PDF**

This project aims to develop a user-friendly system that allows users to interact with and retrieve information from PDFs using a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach. The system will leverage the capabilities of the Gemma-2b LLM for domain especific questions.

**Key Functionalities:**

PDF Ingestion and Processing:

* The system accepts user-uploaded PDFs or integrates with existing document storage solutions.
* Text extraction techniques are employed to convert the PDF content into a format suitable for further processing (demonstrated with PyPDFLoader).

Advanced Retrieval with Chroma:

* A robust retrieval component is implemented using Chroma, a vector store for efficient document search. This component retrieves the most relevant passages within the PDF based on the user's query (demonstrated with Chroma.from_documents).
* Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) is used to ensure diverse and non-redundant results.

Integration with Gemma-2b LLM through LangChain:

* LangChain facilitates the creation of the RAG pipeline.
* The retrieved passages are used to create a context for the Gemma-2b LLM, accessed through a Hugging Face Endpoint (demonstrated with HuggingFaceEndpoint).
* A user-defined prompt (demonstrated with PromptTemplate) can be incorporated to guide the LLM in generating a comprehensive and informative response to the user's query.

Conversational Interaction:

* The code demonstrates the potential for a conversational interface using ConversationalRetrievalChain.
* This allows users to ask follow-up questions based on previous responses, maintaining a conversation context using a memory buffer (ConversationBufferMemory).
