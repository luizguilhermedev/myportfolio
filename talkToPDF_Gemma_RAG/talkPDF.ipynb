        "This project aims to develop a user-friendly system that allows users to interact with and retrieve information from PDFs using a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach.\n",
        "The system will leverage the capabilities of the Gemma-2b LLM for domain especific questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Functionalities:\n",
        "\n",
        "### PDF Ingestion and Processing:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The system accepts user-uploaded PDFs or integrates with existing document storage solutions.\n",
        "* Text extraction techniques are employed to convert the PDF content into a format suitable for further processing (demonstrated with PyPDFLoader).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advanced Retrieval with Chroma:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A robust retrieval component is implemented using Chroma, a vector store for efficient document search. This component retrieves the most relevant passages within the PDF based on the user's query (demonstrated with Chroma.from_documents).\n",
        "* Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) is used to ensure diverse and non-redundant results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Integration with Gemma-2b LLM through LangChain:\n",
        "\n",
        "* LangChain facilitates the creation of the RAG pipeline.\n",
        "* The retrieved passages are used to create a context for the Gemma-2b LLM, accessed through a Hugging Face Endpoint (demonstrated with HuggingFaceEndpoint).\n",
        "* A user-defined prompt (demonstrated with PromptTemplate) can be incorporated to guide the LLM in generating a comprehensive and informative response to the user's query.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conversational Interaction:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The code demonstrates the potential for a conversational interface using ConversationalRetrievalChain.\n",
        "* This allows users to ask follow-up questions based on previous responses, maintaining a conversation context using a memory buffer (ConversationBufferMemory).\n"

These specific documents will be returned because they are highly-relevant to what the employee has input.

After fine-tuning for downstream tasks,\\nPLMs surpass the performance gains of traditional language\\nmodeling (LM). The larger PLMs bring more performance\\ngains, which has led to the transitioning of PLMs to LLMs by\\nsignificantly increasing model parameters (tens to hundreds of\\nbillions) [10] and training dataset (many GBs and TBs) [10],\\n[11]. Following this development, numerous LLMs have been\\nproposed in the literature [10], [11], [12], [6], [13], [14], [15].\\nAn increasing trend in the number of released LLMs and\\nnames of a few significant LLMs proposed over the years are\\nshown in Fig 1 and Fig 2, respectively.\\nThe early work on LLMs, such as T5 [10] and mT5 [11]\\nemployed transfer learning until GPT-3 [6] showing LLMs are\\nzero-shot transferable to downstream tasks without fine-tuning.\\nLLMs accurately respond to task queries when prompted\\nwith task descriptions and examples. However, pre-trained\\nLLMs fail to follow user intent and perform worse in zero-\\nshot settings than in few-shot. Fine-tuning them with taskinstructions data [16], [17], [18], [19] and aligning with human\\npreferences [20], [21] enhances generalization to unseen tasks,\\nimproving zero-shot performance significantly and reducing\\nmisaligned behavior.\\nIn addition to better generalization and domain adaptation,\\nLLMs appear to have emergent abilities, such as reasoning,\\nplanning, decision-making, in-context learning, answering in\\nzero-shot settings, etc. These abilities are known to be acquired\\nby them due to their gigantic scale even when the pre-\\ntrained LLMs are not trained specifically to possess these\\nattributes [22], [23], [24]. Such abilities have led LLMs widely\\nadopted in diverse settings including, multi-modal, robotics,\\ntool manipulation, question answering, autonomous agents,\\netc. Various improvements have also been suggested in these\\nareas either by task-specific training [25], [26], [27], [28], [29],\\n[30], [31] or better prompting [32].\\nThe LLMs abilities to solve diverse tasks with human-level\\nperformance come at a cost of slow training and inference,\\nextensive hardware requirements, and higher running costs.\\nSuch requirements have limited their adoption and opened up\\nopportunities to devise better architectures [15], [33], [34],\\n[35] and training strategies [36], [37], [21], [38], [39], [40],\\n[41].

B ACKGROUND\\nWe provide the relevant background to understand the\\nfundamentals related to LLMs in this section. We briefly\\ndiscuss necessary components in LLMs and refer the readers\\ninterested in details to the original works.\\nA. Tokenization\\nTokenization [59] is an essential pre-processing step in\\nLLM training that parses the text into non-decomposing units\\ncalled tokens. Tokens can be characters, subwords [60], sym-\\nbols [61], or words, depending on the tokenization process.\\nSome of the commonly used tokenization schemes in LLMs\\ninclude wordpiece [62], byte pair encoding (BPE) [61], and\\nunigramLM [60]. Readers are encouraged to refer to [63] for\\na detailed survey.\\nB. Encoding Positions\\nThe transformer processes input sequences in parallel and\\nindependently of each other. Moreover, the attention module\\nin the transformer does not capture positional information.\\nAs a result, positional encodings were introduced in trans-\\nformer [64], where a positional embedding vector is added\\nwith the token embedding. Variants of positional embedding\\ninclude absolute, relative, or learned positional encodings.\\nWithin relative encoding, Alibi and RoPE are two widely used\\npositional embeddings in LLMs.\\nAlibi [65]: It subtracts a scalar bias from the attention score\\nthat increases with the distance between token positions. This\\nfavors using recent tokens for attention.\\nRoPE [66]: It rotates query and key representations at an\\nangle proportional to the token absolute position in the input\\nsequence, resulting in a relative positional encoding scheme\\nwhich decays with the distance between the tokens.\\nC. Attention in LLMs\\nThe attention assigns weights to input tokens based\\non importance so that the model emphasizes more on\\nrelevant over irrelevant tokens. Attention in transformers [64]\\ncalculates query, key, and value mappings for input sequences,\\nwhere the attention score is obtained by multiplying the queryand key, later used to weight values. We discuss different\\nattention strategies used in LLMs below.\\nSelf-Attention [64]: Calculates attention using queries, keys,\\nand values from the same block (encoder or decoder).\\nCross Attention: It is used in encoder-decoder architecture,\\nwhere encoder outputs are the queries, and key-value pairs\\ncome from the decoder.\\nSparse Attention [67]: Self-attention has O(n2)time\\ncomplexity which becomes infeasible for large sequences. To\\nspeed up the computation, sparse attention [67] iteratively\\ncalculates the attention in sliding windows for speed gains.\\nFlash Attention [68]: Memory access is the major bottleneck\\nin calculating attention using GPUs. To speed up, flash\\nattention employs input tiling to minimize the memory reads\\nand writes between the GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM)\\nand the on-chip SRAM.\\nD. Activation Functions\\nThe activation functions serve a crucial role in the curve-\\nfitting abilities of the neural networks [69]. We discuss acti-\\nvation functions used in LLMs in this section.\\nReLU [70]: Rectified linear unit (ReLU) is defined as\\nReLU (x) =max(0, x) (1)\\nGeLU [71]: Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GeLU) is the com-\\nbination of ReLU, dropout [72] and zoneout [73].\\nGLU variants [74]: Gated Linear Unit [75] is a neural\\nnetwork layer that is an element-wise product ( ⊗) of a linear\\ntransformation and a sigmoid transformed ( σ) linear projection\\nof the input given as\\nGLU (x, W, V, b, c ) = (xW+b)⊗σ(xV+c), (2)\\nwhere Xis the input of layer and l,W, b, V andcare learned\\nparameters.\\nOther GLU variants [74] used in LLMs are:\\nReGLU (x, W, V, b, c ) =max(0, xW +b)⊗,\\nGEGLU (x, W, V, b, c ) =GELU (xW+b)⊗(xV+c),\\nSwiGLU (x, W, V, b, c, β ) =Swishβ (xW+b)⊗(xV+c).\\nE. Layer Normalization\\nLayer normalization leads to faster convergence and is an\\nintegrated component of transformers [64]. Besides Layer-\\nNorm [76] and RMSNorm [77], LLMs use pre-layer normal-\\nization [78], applying it before multi-head attention (MHA).\\nPre-norm is shown to provide training stability in LLMs.\\nAnother normalization variant, DeepNorm [79] fixes larger\\ngradient issue in pre-norm.\\nF . Distributed LLM Training\\nThis section describes distributed LLM training approaches\\nbriefly. More details are available in [13], [37], [80], [81].\\nData Parallelism: Data parallelism replicates the model on\\nmultiple devices where data in a batch gets divided across', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 5\\ndevices. At the end of each training iteration weights are\\nsynchronized across all devices.\\nTensor Parallelism: Tensor parallelism shards a tensor compu-\\ntation across devices.

This is also known as vertical paral-\\nlelism.\\nModel Parallelism: A combination of tensor and pipeline\\nparallelism is known as model parallelism.\\n3D Parallelism: A combination of data, tensor, and model\\nparallelism is known as 3D parallelism.\\nOptimizer Parallelism: Optimizer parallelism also known as\\nzero redundancy optimizer [37] implements optimizer state\\npartitioning, gradient partitioning, and parameter partitioning\\nacross devices to reduce memory consumption while keeping\\nthe communication costs as low as possible.\\nG. Libraries\\nSome commonly used libraries for LLMs training are: 1)\\nTransformers [82], 2) DeepSpeed [36], 3) Megatron-LM [80],\\n4) JAX [83], 5) Colossal-AI [84], 6) BMTrain [81], 7)\\nFastMoE [85], and frameworks are 1) MindSpore [86], 2)\\nPyTorch [87], 3) Tensorflow [88], 4) MXNet [89].\\nH. Data PreProcessing\\nThis section briefly summarizes data preprocessing\\ntechniques used in LLMs training.\\nQuality Filtering: For better results, training data quality is\\nessential. Some approaches to filtering data are: 1) classifier-\\nbased and 2) heuristics-based. Classifier-based approaches\\ntrain a classifier on high-quality data and predict the quality of\\ntext for filtering, whereas heuristics-based employ some rules\\nfor filtering like language, metrics, statistics, and keywords.\\nData Deduplication: Duplicated data can affect model\\nperformance and increase data memorization; therefore, to\\ntrain LLMs, data deduplication is one of the preprocessing\\nsteps. This can be performed at multiple levels, like sentences,\\ndocuments, and datasets.\\nPrivacy Reduction: Most of the training data for LLMs is\\ncollected through web sources. This data contains private\\ninformation; therefore, many LLMs employ heuristics-based\\nmethods to filter information such as names, addresses, and\\nphone numbers to avoid learning personal information.\\nI. Architectures\\nHere we discuss the variants of the transformer architectures\\nused in LLMs. The difference arises due to the application\\nof the attention and the connection of transformer blocks. An\\nillustration of attention patterns of these architectures is shown\\nin Figure 4.\\nEncoder Decoder: This architecture processes inputs\\nthrough the encoder and passes the intermediate representation\\nto the decoder to generate the output. Here, the encoder\\nsees the complete sequence utilizing self-attention whereas\\nFig. 4: An example of attention patterns in language models,\\nimage is taken from [90].\\nFig. 5: An example of language model training objectives,\\nimage from [90].\\nthe decoder processes the sequence one after other with\\nimplementing cross-attention.\\nCausal Decoder: A type of architecture that does not have\\nencoder and processes and generates output using decoder,\\nwhere predicted token depends only on the previous time steps.\\nPrefix Decoder: Also known as non-causal decoder, where\\nthe attention calculation is not strictly dependant on the past\\ninformation and the attention is bidirectional. An example of\\nnon-causal attention mask is shown in Figure 4.\\nJ. Pre-Training Objectives\\nThis section describes LLMs pre-training objectives. For\\nmore details see the paper [90].\\nFull Language Modeling: An autoregressive language\\nmodeling objective where the model is asked to predict future\\ntokens given the previous tokens, an example is shown in\\nFigure 5.\\nPrefix Language Modeling: A non-causal training objective,\\nwhere a prefix is chosen randomly and only remaining target\\ntokens are used to calculate the loss. An example is shown in\\nFigure 5.\\nMasked Language Modeling: In this training objective,\\ntokens or spans (a sequence of tokens) are masked randomly\\nand the model is asked to predict masked tokens given the\\npast and future context. An example is shown in Figure 5.\\nUnified Language Modeling: Unified language modeling [91]\\nis a combination of causal, non-causal, and masked language\\ntraining objectives. Here in masked language modeling, the\\nattention is not bidirectional but unidirectional, attending\\neither left-to-right or right-to-left context.\\nK. LLMs Adaptation Stages\\nThis section discusses the fundamentals of LLMs adaptation\\nstages, from pre-training to fine-tuning for downstream tasks', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 6\\nFig. 6: A basic flow diagram depicting various stages of LLMs from pre-training to prompting/utilization. Prompting LLMs\\nto generate responses is possible at different training stages like pre-training, instruction-tuning, or alignment tuning.\\nand utilization. An example of different training stages and\\ninference in LLMs is shown in Figure 6. In this paper, we refer\\nalignment-tuning to aligning with human preferences, while\\noccasionally the literature uses the term alignment for different\\npurposes.\\n1. Pre-Training: In the very first stage, the model is trained\\nin a self-supervised manner on a large corpus to predict the\\nnext tokens given the input. The design choices of LLMs vary\\nfrom encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures with dif-\\nferent building blocks and loss functions in sections II-E, II-D,\\nII-J.\\n2. Fine-Tuning: There are different styles to fine-tune an\\nLLM. This section briefly discusses fine-tuning approaches.\\nTransfer Learning: The pre-trained LLMs perform well for\\nvarious tasks [6], [15]. But to improve the performance for\\na downstream task, pre-trained models are fine-tuned with\\nthe task-specific data [10], [11], known as transfer learning.\\nInstruction-tuning: To enable a model to respond to user\\nqueries effectively, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned on\\ninstruction formatted data i.e., instruction and an input-output\\npair. Instructions generally comprise multi-task data in plain\\nnatural language, guiding the model to respond according to\\nthe prompt and the input. This type of fine-tuning improveszero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.\\nDetails on formatting instruction data and its various styles\\nare available in [16], [50], [92].\\nAlignment-tuning: LLMs are prone to generate false, biased,\\nand harmful text. To make them helpful, honest, and harmless\\nmodels are aligned using human feedback. Alignment involves\\nasking LLMs to generate unexpected responses and then\\nupdating their parameters to avoid such responses [20], [21],\\n[93].\\nIt ensures LLMs operate according to human intentions and\\nvalues. A model is defined to be an “aligned” model if the\\nmodel fulfills three criteria of helpful, honest, and harmless or\\n“HHH” [94].\\nResearchers employ reinforcement learning with human feed-\\nback (RLHF) [95] for model alignment. In RLHF, a fine-\\ntuned model on demonstrations is further trained with reward\\nmodeling (RM) and reinforcement learning (RL), shown in\\nFigure 6. Below we briefly discuss RM and RL pipelines in\\nRLHF.\\nReward modeling: trains a model to rank generated responses\\naccording to human preferences using a classification objec-\\ntive. To train the classifier humans annotate LLMs generated\\nresponses based on HHH criteria.', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 7\\nReinforcement learning: in combination with the reward model\\nis used for alignment in the next stage. The previously trained\\nreward model ranks LLM-generated responses into preferred\\nvs. dispreferred, which is used to align the model with proxi-\\nmal policy optimization (PPO). This process repeats iteratively\\nuntil convergence.\\n3. Prompting/Utilization: Prompting is a method to query\\ntrained LLMs for generating responses, as illustrated in Fig-\\nure 6. LLMs can be prompted in various prompt setups,\\nwhere they can be adapted to the instructions without fine-\\ntuning and in other cases with fine-tuning on data containing\\ndifferent prompt styles [16], [96], [97]. A good guide on\\nprompt engineering is available at [32]. Below, we will discuss\\nvarious widely used prompt setups.\\nZero-Shot Prompting: LLMs are zero-shot learners and ca-\\npable of answering queries never seen before. This style of\\nprompting requires LLMs to answer user questions without\\nseeing any examples in the prompt.\\nIn-context Learning: Also known as few-shot learning, here,\\nmultiple input-output demonstration pairs are shown to the\\nmodel to generate the desired response. This adaptation style\\nis also called few-shot learning. A discussion on formatting\\nin-context learning (ICL) templates is available in [54], [50],\\n[18], [16].\\nReasoning in LLMs: LLMs are zero-shot reasoners and can\\nbe provoked to generate answers to logical problems, task\\nplanning, critical thinking, etc. with reasoning. Generating\\nreasons is possible only by using different prompting styles,\\nwhereas to improve LLMs further on reasoning tasks many\\nmethods [16], [92] train them on reasoning datasets. We\\ndiscuss various prompting techniques for reasoning below.\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT): A special case of prompting where\\ndemonstrations contain reasoning information aggregated with\\ninputs and outputs so that the model generates outcomes\\nwith step-by-step reasoning. More details on CoT prompts are\\navailable in [55], [98], [96].\\nSelf-Consistency: Improves CoT performance by generat-\\ning multiple responses and selecting the most frequent an-\\nswer [99].\\nTree-of-Thought (ToT): Explores multiple reasoning paths\\nwith possibilities to look ahead and backtrack for problem-\\nsolving [100].\\nSingle-Turn Instructions: In this prompting setup, LLMs\\nare queried only once with all the relevant information in\\nthe prompt. LLMs generate responses by understanding the\\ncontext either in a zero-shot or few-shot setting.\\nMulti-Turn Instructions: Solving a complex task requires\\nmultiple interactions with LLMs, where feedback and re-\\nsponses from the other tools are given as input to the LLM\\nfor the next rounds. This style of using LLMs in the loop is\\ncommon in autonomous agents.\\nIII. L ARGE LANGUAGE MODELS\\nThis section reviews LLMs, briefly describing their architec-\\ntures, training objectives, pipelines, datasets, and fine-tuning\\ndetails.\\nFig. 7: Unified text-to-text training example, source image\\nfrom [10].\\nA. Pre-Trained LLMs\\nHere, we provide summaries of various well-known pre-\\ntrained LLMs with significant discoveries, changing the course\\nof research and development in NLP. These LLMs have\\nconsiderably improved the performance in NLU and NLG\\ndomains, and are widely fine-tuned for downstream tasks.\\nWe identify critical information of pre-trained LLMs in Ta-\\nble I and II that improve their performance.\\n1. General Purpose:\\n1.1 T5 [10]: An encoder-decoder model employing a\\nunified text-to-text training for all NLP problems, shown in\\nFigure 7. T5 places layer normalization outside the residual\\npath in a conventional transformer model [64]. It uses masked\\nlanguage modeling as a pre-training objective where spans\\n(consecutive tokens) are replaced with a single mask instead of\\nseparate masks for each token. This type of masking speeds\\nup the training as it produces shorter sequences. After pre-\\ntraining, the model is fine-tuned using adapter layers [101]\\nfor downstream tasks.\\n1.2 GPT-3 [6]: The GPT-3 architecture is same as the\\nGPT-2 [5] but with dense and sparse attention in transformer\\nlayers similar to the Sparse Transformer [67]. It shows that\\nlarge models can train on larger batch sizes with a lower\\nlearning rate; in order to decide the batch size during training,\\nGPT-3 uses the gradient noise scale as in [102]. Overall,\\nGPT-3 increases model parameters to 175B showing that the\\nperformance of large language models improves with the scale\\nand is competitive with the fine-tuned models.\\n1.3 mT5 [11]: A multilingual T5 model [10] trained on\\nthe mC4 dataset with 101 languages. The dataset is extracted\\nfrom the public common crawl scrape. The model uses a\\nlarger vocabulary size of 250,000 to cover multiple languages.\\nTo avoid over-fitting or under-fitting for a language, mT5\\nemploys a data sampling procedure to select samples from all\\nlanguages. The paper suggests using a small amount of pre-\\ntraining datasets, including all languages when fine-tuning for\\na task using English language data. This allows the model to\\ngenerate correct non-English outputs.\\n1.4 PanGu- α[103]: An autoregressive model that has a\\nquery layer at the end of standard transformer layers, example\\nshown in Figure 8, with aim to predict next token. Its structure\\nis similar to the transformer layer but with an additional\\nembedding for the next position in the attention mechanism,\\ngiven in Eq. 3.\\na=pnWq\\nhWk\\nhTHT\\nL (3)', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 8\\nFig. 8: The image is the article of [103], showing an example\\nof PanGu- αarchitecture.\\n1.5 CPM-2 [12]: Cost-efficient Pre-trained language\\nModels (CPM-2) pre-trains bilingual (English and Chinese)\\n11B and 198B mixture-of-experts (MoE) models on the Wu-\\nDaoCorpus [104] dataset. The tokenization process removes\\n“_” white space tokens in the sentencepiece tokenizer. The\\nmodels are trained with knowledge inheritance, starting with\\nonly the Chinese language in the first stage and then adding\\nEnglish and Chinese data. This trained model gets duplicated\\nmultiple times to initialize the 198B MoE model. Moreover,\\nto use the model for downstream tasks, CPM-2 experimented\\nwith both complete fine-tuning and prompt fine-tuning as\\nin [40] where only prompt-related parameters are updated\\nby inserting prompts at various positions, front, middle, and\\nback. CPM-2 also proposes INFMOE, a memory-efficient\\nframework with a strategy to dynamically offload parameters\\nto the CPU for inference at a 100B scale. It overlaps data\\nmovement with inference computation for lower inference\\ntime.\\n1.6 ERNIE 3.0 [105]: ERNIE 3.0 takes inspiration from\\nmulti-task learning to build a modular architecture using\\nTransformer-XL [106] as the backbone. The universal repre-\\nsentation module is shared by all the tasks, which serve as the\\nbasic block for task-specific representation modules, which are\\nall trained jointly for natural language understanding, natural\\nlanguage generation, and knowledge extraction. This LLM is\\nprimarily focused on the Chinese language, claims to train\\non the largest Chinese text corpora for LLM training, and\\nachieved state-of-the-art in 54 Chinese NLP tasks.\\n1.7 Jurassic-1 [107]: A pair of auto-regressive language\\nmodels, including a 7B-parameter J1-Large model and a\\n178B-parameter J1-Jumbo model. The training vocabulary of\\nJurassic-1 comprise word pieces, complete words, and multi-\\nword expressions without any word boundaries, where possible\\nout-of-vocabulary instances are interpreted as Unicode bytes.\\nCompared to the GPT-3 counterparts, the Jurassic-1 models\\napply a more balanced depth-to-width self-attention architec-\\nture [108] and an improved tokenizer for a faster prediction\\nbased on broader resources, achieving a comparable perfor-\\nmance in zero-shot learning tasks and a superior performance\\nin few-shot learning tasks given the ability to feed moreexamples as a prompt.\\n1.8 HyperCLOVA [109]: A Korean language model with\\nGPT-3 architecture.\\n1.9 Yuan 1.0 [110]: Trained on a Chinese corpus with\\n5TB of high-quality text collected from the Internet. A\\nMassive Data Filtering System (MDFS) built on Spark is\\ndeveloped to process the raw data via coarse and fine filtering\\ntechniques. To speed up the training of Yuan 1.0 with the\\naim of saving energy expenses and carbon emissions, various\\nfactors that improve the performance of distributed training\\nare incorporated in architecture and training like increasing\\nthe number of hidden size improves pipeline and tensor par-\\nallelism performance, larger micro batches improve pipeline\\nparallelism performance, and higher global batch size improve\\ndata parallelism performance. In practice, the Yuan 1.0 model\\nperforms well on text classification, Winograd Schema, natural\\nlanguage inference, and reading comprehension tasks.\\n1.10 Gopher [111]: The Gopher family of models ranges\\nfrom 44M to 280B parameters in size to study the effect of\\nscale on the LLMs performance. The 280B model beats GPT-\\n3 [6], Jurrasic-1 [107], MT-NLG [112], and others on 81% of\\nthe evaluated tasks.\\n1.11 ERNIE 3.0 TITAN [35]: ERNIE 3.0 Titan extends\\nERNIE 3.0 by training a larger model with 26x the number of\\nparameters of the latter. This bigger model outperformed other\\nstate-of-the-art models in 68 NLP tasks. LLMs produce text\\nwith incorrect facts. In order to have control of the generated\\ntext with factual consistency, ERNIE 3.0 Titan adds another\\ntask, Credible and Controllable Generations , to its multi-\\ntask learning setup. It introduces additional self-supervised\\nadversarial and controllable language modeling losses to the\\npre-training step, which enables ERNIE 3.0 Titan to beat\\nother LLMs in their manually selected Factual QA task set\\nevaluations.\\n1.12 GPT-NeoX-20B [113]: An auto-regressive model\\nthat largely follows GPT-3 with a few deviations in architec-\\nture design, trained on the Pile dataset without any data dedu-\\nplication. GPT-NeoX has parallel attention and feed-forward\\nlayers in a transformer block, given in Eq. 4, that increases\\nthroughput by 15%. It uses rotary positional embedding [66],\\napplying it to only 25% of embedding vector dimension as\\nin [114]. This reduces the computation without performance\\ndegradation. Opposite to GPT-3, which uses dense and sparse\\nlayers, GPT-NeoX-20B uses only dense layers. The hyperpa-\\nrameter tuning at this scale is difficult; therefore, the model\\nchooses hyperparameters from the method [6] and interpolates\\nvalues between 13B and 175B models for the 20B model. The\\nmodel training is distributed among GPUs using both tensor\\nand pipeline parallelism.\\nx+Attn(LN1(x)) +FF(LN2(x)) (4)\\n1.13 OPT [14]: It is a clone of GPT-3, developed with\\nthe intention to open-source a model that replicates GPT-3\\nperformance. Training of OPT employs dynamic loss scaling\\n[115] and restarts from an earlier checkpoint with a lower\\nlearning rate whenever loss divergence is observed. Overall,\\nthe performance of OPT-175B models is comparable to the\\nGPT3-175B model.', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 9\\nFig. 9: The BLOOM architecture example sourced from [13].\\n1.14 BLOOM [13]: A causal decoder model trained\\non ROOTS corpus with the aim of open-sourcing an LLM.\\nThe architecture of BLOOM is shown in Figure 9, with\\ndifferences like ALiBi positional embedding, an additional\\nnormalization layer after the embedding layer as suggested\\nby the bitsandbytes1library. These changes stabilize training\\nwith improved downstream performance.\\n1.15 GLaM [116]: Generalist Language Model (GLaM)\\nrepresents a family of language models using a sparsely acti-\\nvated decoder-only mixture-of-experts (MoE) structure [117],\\n[118]. To gain more model capacity while reducing compu-\\ntation, the experts are sparsely activated where only the best\\ntwo experts are used to process each input token. The largest\\nGLaM model, GLaM (64B/64E), is about 7 ×larger than GPT-\\n3 [6], while only a part of the parameters is activated per input\\ntoken. The largest GLaM (64B/64E) model achieves better\\noverall results as compared to GPT-3 while consuming only\\none-third of GPT-3’s training energy.\\n1.16 MT-NLG [112]: A 530B causal decoder based on\\nGPT-2 architecture that is roughly 3 ×GPT-3 model parame-\\nters. MT-NLG is trained on filtered high-quality data collected\\nfrom various public datasets and blends various types of\\ndatasets in a single batch, which beats GPT-3 on a number\\nof evaluations.\\n1.17 Chinchilla [119]: A causal decoder trained on the\\nsame dataset as the Gopher [111] but with a little different\\ndata sampling distribution (sampled from MassiveText). The\\nmodel architecture is similar to the one used for Gopher,\\nwith the exception of AdamW optimizer instead of Adam.\\nChinchilla identifies the relationship that model size should\\nbe doubled for every doubling of training tokens. Over 400\\nlanguage models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion\\nparameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens are trained to get the\\nestimates for compute-optimal training under a given budget.\\nThe authors train a 70B model with the same compute budget\\nas Gopher (280B) but with 4 times more data. It outperforms\\nGopher [111], GPT-3 [6], and others on various downstream\\ntasks, after fine-tuning.\\n1.18 AlexaTM [120]: An encoder-decoder model, where\\nencoder weights and decoder embeddings are initialized with\\na pre-trained encoder to speedup training. The encoder stays\\nfrozen for initial 100k steps and later unfreezed for end-to-end\\ntraining. The model is trained on a combination of denoising\\n1https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytesand causal language modeling (CLM) objectives, concate-\\nnating [CLM ]token at the beginning for mode switiching.\\nDuring training, the CLM task is applied for 20% of the time,\\nwhich improves the in-context learning performance.\\n1.19 PaLM [15]: A causal decoder with parallel atten-\\ntion and feed-forward layers similar to Eq. 4, speeding up\\ntraining 15 times faster. Additional changes to the conven-\\ntional transformer model include SwiGLU activation, RoPE\\nembeddings, multi-query attention that saves computation cost\\nduring decoding, and shared input-output embeddings. During\\ntraining, loss spiking was observed, and to fix it, model\\ntraining was restarted from a 100 steps earlier checkpoint\\nby skipping 200-500 batches around the spike. Moreover, the\\nmodel was found to memorize around 2.4% of the training\\ndata at the 540B model scale, whereas this number was lower\\nfor smaller models.\\nPaLM-2 [121]: A smaller multi-lingual variant of PaLM,\\ntrained for larger iterations on a better quality dataset. The\\nPaLM-2 shows significant improvements over PaLM, while\\nreducing training and inference costs due to its smaller size.\\nTo lessen toxicity and memorization, it appends special tokens\\nwith a fraction of pre-training data, which shows reduction in\\ngenerating harmful responses.\\n1.20 U-PaLM [122]: This method trains PaLM for 0.1%\\nadditional compute with UL2 (also named as UL2Restore) ob-\\njective [123] using the same dataset and outperforms baseline\\nsignificantly on various NLP tasks, including zero-shot, few-\\nshot, commonsense reasoning, CoT, etc. Training with UL2R\\ninvolves converting a causal decoder PaLM to a non-causal\\ndecoder PaLM and employing 50% sequential denoising, 25%\\nregular denoising, and 25% extreme denoising loss functions.\\n1.21 UL2 [123]: An encoder-decoder architecture\\ntrained using a mixture of denoisers (MoD) objectives. De-\\nnoisers include 1) R-Denoiser: a regular span masking, 2)\\nS-Denoiser: which corrupts consecutive tokens of a large\\nsequence and 3) X-Denoiser: which corrupts a large number of\\ntokens randomly. During pre-training, UL2 includes a denoiser\\ntoken from R, S, X to represent a denoising setup. It helps\\nimprove fine-tuning performance for downstream tasks that\\nbind the task to one of the upstream training modes. This\\nMoD style of training outperforms the T5 model on many\\nbenchmarks.\\n1.22 GLM-130B [33]: GLM-130B is a bilingual (En-\\nglish and Chinese) model trained using an auto-regressive\\nmask infilling pre-training objective similar to the GLM [124].\\nThis training style makes the model bidirectional as compared\\nto GPT-3, which is unidirectional. Opposite to the GLM, the\\ntraining of GLM-130B includes a small amount of multi-task\\ninstruction pre-training data (5% of the total data) along with\\nthe self-supervised mask infilling. To stabilize the training, it\\napplies embedding layer gradient shrink.\\n1.23 LLaMA [125], [21]: A set of decoder-only lan-\\nguage models varying from 7B to 70B parameters. LLaMA\\nmodels series is the most famous among the community for\\nparameter-efficient and instruction tuning.\\nLLaMA-1 [125]: Implements efficient causal attention [126]\\nby not storing and computing masked attention weights and\\nkey/query scores. Another optimization is reducing number of', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 10\\nactivations recomputed in backward pass, as in [127].\\nLLaMA-2 [21]: This work is more focused towards fine-\\ntuning a safer and better LLaMA-2-Chat model for dialogue\\ngeneration. The pre-trained model has 40% more training data\\nwith a larger context length and grouped-query attention.\\n1.24 PanGu- Σ[128]: An autoregressive model with\\nparameters copied from PanGu- αand extended to a trillion\\nscale with Random Routed Experts (RRE), the architectural\\ndiagram is shown in Figure 10. RRE is similar to the MoE\\narchitecture, with distinctions at the second level, where tokens\\nare randomly routed to experts in a domain instead of using a\\nlearnable gating method. The model has bottom layers densely\\nactivated and shared across all domains, whereas top layers are\\nsparsely activated according to the domain. This training style\\nallows extracting task-specific models and reduces catastrophic\\nforgetting effects in case of continual learning.\\n2. Coding:\\n2.1 CodeGen [129]: CodeGen has similar architecture to\\nthe PaLM [15], i.e., parallel attention, MLP layers, and RoPE\\nembeddings. The model is trained on both natural language\\nand programming language data sequentially (trained on the\\nfirst dataset, then the second and so on) on the following\\ndatasets 1) PILE, 2) BIGQUERY and 3) BIGPYTHON. Code-\\nGen proposed a multi-step approach to synthesizing code. The\\npurpose is to simplify the generation of long sequences where\\nthe previous prompt and generated code are given as input with\\nthe next prompt to generate the next code sequence. CodeGen\\nopensource a Multi-Turn Programming Benchmark (MTPB)\\nto evaluate multi-step program synthesis.\\n2.2 Codex [130]: This LLM is trained on a subset\\nof public Python Github repositories to generate code from\\ndocstrings. Computer programming is an iterative process\\nwhere the programs are often debugged and updated before\\nfulfilling the requirements. Similarly to this, Codex generates\\n100 versions of a program by repetitive sampling for a given\\ndescription, which produces a working solution for 77.5% of\\nthe problems passing unit tests. Its powerful version powers\\nGithub Copilot2.\\n2.3 AlphaCode [131]: A set of large language mod-\\nels, ranging from 300M to 41B parameters, designed for\\ncompetition-level code generation tasks. It uses the multi-\\nquery attention [132] to reduce memory and cache costs.\\nSince competitive programming problems highly require deep\\nreasoning and an understanding of complex natural language\\nalgorithms, the AlphaCode models are pre-trained on filtered\\nGitHub code in popular languages and then fine-tuned on a\\nnew competitive programming dataset named CodeContests.\\nThe CodeContests dataset mainly contains problems, solu-\\ntions, and test cases collected from the Codeforces platform3.\\nThe pre-training employs standard language modeling objec-\\ntives, while GOLD [133] with tempering [134] serves as the\\ntraining objective for the fine-tuning on CodeContests data. To\\nevaluate the performance of AlphaCode, simulated program-\\nming competitions are hosted on the Codeforces platform:\\noverall, AlphaCode ranks at the top 54.3% among over 5000\\n2https://github.com/features/copilot\\n3https://codeforces.com/competitors, where its Codeforces rating is within the top 28%\\nof recently participated users.\\n2.4 CodeT5+ [34]: CodeT5+ is based on CodeT5 [135],\\nwith shallow encoder and deep decoder, trained in multiple\\nstages initially unimodal data (code) and later bimodal data\\n(text-code pairs). Each training stage has different training\\nobjectives and activates different model blocks encoder, de-\\ncoder, or both according to the task. The unimodal pre-training\\nincludes span denoising and CLM objectives, whereas bimodal\\npre-training objectives contain contrastive learning, matching,\\nand CLM for text-code pairs. CodeT5+ adds special tokens\\nwith the text to enable task modes, for example, [CLS]for\\ncontrastive loss, [Match ]for text-code matching, etc.\\n2.5 StarCoder [136]: A decoder-only model with San-\\ntaCoder architecture, employing Flash attention to scale up\\nthe context length to 8k. The StarCoder trains an encoder to\\nfilter names, emails, and other personal data from the training\\ndata. Its fine-tuned variant outperforms PaLM, LLaMA, and\\nLAMDA on HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks.\\n3. Scientific Knowledge:\\n3.1 Galactica [137]: A large curated corpus of human\\nscientific knowledge with 48 million papers, textbooks, lecture\\nnotes, millions of compounds and proteins, scientific websites,\\nencyclopedias, and more are trained using metaseq library3,\\nwhich is built on PyTorch and fairscale [138]. The model\\nwraps reasoning datasets with < work > token to provide\\nstep-by-step reasoning context to the model, which has been\\nshown to improve the performance on reasoning tasks.\\n4. Dialog:\\n4.1 LaMDA [139]: A decoder-only model pre-trained\\non public dialog data, public dialog utterances, and public\\nweb documents, where more than 90% of the pre-training\\ndata is in English. LaMDA is trained with the objective\\nof producing responses that exhibit high levels of quality,\\nsafety, and groundedness. To achieve this, discriminative and\\ngenerative fine-tuning techniques are incorporated to enhance\\nthe model’s safety and quality aspects. As a result, the LaMDA\\nmodels can be utilized as a general language model performing\\nvarious tasks.\\n5. Finance:\\n5.1 BloombergGPT [140]: A non-causal decoder model\\ntrained using both financial (\"FINPILE\" from the Bloomberg\\narchive) and general-purpose datasets.

Fine-Tuned LLMs\\nPre-trained LLMs have excellent generalization abilities to\\nunseen tasks. However, because they are generally trained with\\nthe objective of next token prediction, LLMs have limited\\ncapacity to follow user intent and are prone to generate\\nunethical, toxic or inaccurate responses [20]. For their effective\\nutilization, LLMs are fine-tuned to follow instructions [16],\\n[17], [92] and generate safe responses [20], which also results\\nin increasing zero-shot, few-shot, and cross-task generaliza-\\ntion [92], [16], [18], with minimal compute increment, e.g.,\\n0.2% of the total pre-training for PaLM 540B [16].\\nWe review various fine-tuned LLMs and strategies for effective\\nfine-tuning in this section.\\n1. Instruction-Tuning with Manually Created Datasets:\\nNumerous hand-crafted instruction-tuning datasets with\\ndifferent design choices are proposed in the literature to\\ninstruction-tune LLMs. The performance of fine-tuned LLMs\\ndepends on multiple factors, such as dataset, instruction\\ndiversity, prompting templates, model size, and training', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 13\\nTABLE II: Key insights and findings from the study of instruction-tuned Large Language Models.\\nModels Findings & Insights\\nT0•Multi-task prompting enables zero-shot generalization and outperforms baselines\\n•Even a single prompt per dataset task is enough to improve performance\\nWebGPT•The answer quality of LLMs can be further improved with human feedback.\\n•To aid the model in effectively filtering and utilizing relevant information, human labelers play a crucial role in answering\\nquestions regarding the usefulness of the retrieved documents.\\n•Interacting a fine-tuned language model with a text-based web-browsing environment can improve end-to-end retrieval and\\nsynthesis via imitation learning and reinforcement learning.\\n•Generating answers with references can make labelers easily judge the factual accuracy of answers.\\nTk-INSTRUCT•Instruction tuning leads to a stronger generalization of unseen tasks\\n•More tasks improve generalization whereas only increasing task instances does not help\\n•Supervised trained models are better than generalized models\\n•Models pre-trained with instructions and examples perform well for different types of inputs\\nmT0 and BLOOMZ•Instruction tuning enables zero-shot generalization to the tasks never seen before\\n•Multi-lingual training leads to even better zero-shot generalization for both English and non-English\\n•Training on machine-translated prompts improves performance for held-out tasks with non-English prompts\\n•English only fine-tuning on multilingual pre-trained language model is enough to generalize to other pre-trained language\\ntasks\\nOPT-IML•Task size sampling to create a batch with most of the task examples is important for better performance\\n•Only example proportional sampling is not enough, training datasets/benchmarks should also be proportional for better\\ngeneralization/performance\\n•Fully held-out and partially supervised tasks performance improves by scaling tasks or categories whereas fully supervised\\ntasks have no effect\\n•Including small amounts i.e. 5% of pretraining data during fine-tuning is effective\\n•Only 1% reasoning data improves the performance, adding more deteriorates performance\\n•Adding dialogue data makes the performance worse\\nFlan•Finetuning with CoT improves performance on held-out tasks\\n•Fine-tuning along with CoT data improves reasoning abilities\\n•CoT tuning improves zero-shot reasoning\\n•Performance improves with more tasks\\n•Instruction fine-tuning improves usability which otherwise is challenging for pre-trained models\\n•Improving the model’s performance with instruction tuning is compute-efficient\\n•Multitask prompting enables zero-shot generalization abilities in LLM\\nSparrow•The judgments of labelers and the alignments with defined rules can help the model generate better responses.\\n•Good dialogue goals can be broken down into detailed natural language rules for the agent and the raters.\\n•The combination of reinforcement learning (RL) with reranking yields optimal performance in terms of preference win rates\\nand resilience against adversarial probing.\\nWizardCoder•Fine-tuning with re-written instruction-tuning data into a complex set improves the performance significantly\\nLLaMA-2-Chat•Model learns to write safe responses with fine-tuning on safe demonstrations, while additional RLHF step further improves\\nmodel safety and make it less prone to jailbreak attacks\\nLIMA•Less high quality data is enough for fine-tuned model generalization\\nobjectives. Keeping this in view, diverse fine-tuned models\\nhave emerged in the literature using manually created datasets.\\nThe models T0 [17] and mT0 (multi-lingual) [143] employ\\ntemplates to convert existing datasets into prompt datasets.\\nThey have shown improvements in generalization to zero-shot\\nand held-out tasks. Tk-Instruct [18] fine-tuned the T5 model\\nwith in-context instructions to study generalization on unseen\\ntasks when given in-context instructions during test time. The\\nmodel outperformed Instruct-GPT, despite being smaller in\\nsize, i.e., 11B parameters as compared to 175B of GPT-3.\\nIncreasing Tasks and Prompt Setups: Zero-shot and few-\\nshot performance improves significantly by expanding task\\ncollection and prompt styles. OPT-IML [92] and Flan [16]\\ncurated larger 2k and 1.8k task datasets, respectively. While\\nincreasing task size alone is not enough, OPT-IML and\\nFlan add more prompting setups in their datasets, zero-shot,\\nfew-shot, and CoT. In continuation, CoT Collection [96]\\nfine-tunes Flan-T5 further on 1.88M CoT samples. Another\\nmethod [97] uses symbolic tasks with tasks in T0, Flan, etc.\\nFig. 11: An example image shows an instance of the Flan\\ntraining paradigm, taken from [16].\\n2. Instruction-Tuning with LLMs Generated Datasets:\\nGenerating an instruction-tuning dataset requires carefully\\nwriting instructions and input-output pairs, which are often', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 12}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 14\\nwritten by humans, smaller in size, and less diverse. To\\novercome this, self-instruct [19] proposed an approach to\\nprompt available LLMs to generate instruction-tuning datasets.\\nSelf-instruct outperformed models trained on manually created\\ndataset SUPER-NATURALINSTRUCTIONS (a dataset with\\n1600+ tasks) [18] by 33%. It starts with a seed of 175 tasks,\\n1 instruction, and 1 sample per task and iteratively generates\\nnew instructions (52k) and instances (82k input-output pairs)\\nusing GPT-3 [6]. Contrary to this, Dynosaur [144] uses the\\nmeta-data of datasets on Huggingface to prompt LLMs to\\ngenerate multiple task instruction-tuning datasets.\\nLLaMA Tuned: Various models in literature instruction-tune\\nLLaMA [145] with GPT-3 [6] or GPT-4 [146] generated\\ndatasets. Among these, Alpaca [147], Vicuna [148], and\\nLLaMA-GPT-4 [149] are a few general-purpose fine-tuned\\nmodels, where Alpaca is trained on 52k samples from text-\\ndavinci-003, Vicuna on 70k samples from ShareGPT.com,\\nand LLaMA-GPT-4 by re-creating Alpaca instructions from\\nGPT-4. Goat [150] fine-tunes LLaMA for arithmetic tasks\\n(1 million samples) by generating data from ChatGPT and\\noutperforms GPT-4, PaLM, BLOOM, OPT, etc, attributing its\\nsuccess to the LLaMA’s consistent tokenization of numbers.\\nHuaTuo [151] is a medical knowledge model, fine-tuned with\\na generated QA dataset of 8k instructions.\\nComplex Instructions: Evol-Instruct [152], [153] prompts\\nLLMs to convert given instructions into a more complex\\nset. The instructions are iteratively evolved with re-\\nwriting instructions in complex wording and creating\\nnew instructions. With this style of automated instruction\\ngeneration, WizardLM [152] (fine-tuned LLaMA on\\n250k instructions), outperforms Vicuna and Alpaca, and\\nWizardCoder [153] (fine-tuned StarCoder) beats Claude-Plus,\\nBard, and others.\\n3. Aligning with Human Preferences: Incorporating\\nhuman preferences into LLMs presents a significant\\nadvantage in mitigating undesirable behaviors and ensuring\\naccurate outputs. The initial work on alignment, such as\\nInstructGPT [20] aligns GPT-3 using a 3-step approach,\\ninstruction-tuning, reward modeling, and fine-tuning with\\nreinforcement learning (RL). The supervised fine-tuned\\nGPT-3 on demonstrations is queried to generate responses,\\nwhich human labelers rank according to human values, and\\na reward model is trained on the ranked data. Lastly, the\\nGPT-3 is trained with proximal policy optimization (PPO)\\nusing rewards on the generated data from the reward model.\\nLLaMA 2-Chat [21] improves alignment by dividing reward\\nmodeling into helpfulness and safety rewards and using\\nrejection sampling in addition to PPO. The initial four\\nversions of LLaMA 2-Chat are fine-tuned with rejection\\nsampling and then with PPO on top of rejection sampling.\\nAligning with Supported Evidence: This style of alignment\\nallows the model to generate responses with proofs and facts,\\nreduces hallucination, and assists humans more effectively,\\nwhich increases trust in the model’s output. Similar to the\\nRLHF training style, a reward model is trained to rank\\ngenerated responses containing web citations in answersto questions, which is later used to train the model, as in\\nGopherCite [154], WebGPT [155], and Sparrow [156]. The\\nranking model in Sparrow [156] is divided into two branches,\\npreference reward and rule reward, where human annotators\\nadversarial probe the model to break a rule. These two\\nrewards together rank a response to train with RL.\\nAligning Directly with SFT: The PPO in the RLHF pipeline\\nis complex, memory-intensive, and unstable, requiring\\nmultiple models, reward, value, policy, and reference models.\\nAvoiding this sophisticated alignment pipeline is possible\\nby incorporating minimal changes in the supervised fine-\\ntuning (SFT) pipeline as in [157], [158], [159], with better\\nor comparable performance to PPO. Direct preference\\noptimization (DPO) [157] trains a model directly on the\\nhuman-preferred responses to maximize the likelihood of\\npreferred against unpreferred responses, with per-sample\\nimportance weight. Reward ranked fine-tuning RAFT [158]\\nfine-tunes the model on ranked responses by the reward\\nmodel. Preference ranking optimization (PRO) [160] and\\nRRHF [159] penalize the model to rank responses with\\nhuman preferences and supervised loss. On the other hand,\\nchain-of-hindsight (CoH) [161] provides feedback to the\\nmodel in language rather than reward, to learn good versus\\nbad responses.\\nAligning with Synthetic Feedback: Aligning LLMs with\\nhuman feedback is slow and costly. The literature suggests a\\nsemi-automated process to align LLMs by prompting LLMs to\\ngenerate helpful, honest, and ethical responses to the queries,\\nand fine-tuning using the newly created dataset. Constitutional\\nAI [162] replaces human feedback in RLHF with AI, calling\\nit RL from AI feedback (RLAIF). AlpacaFarm [163] designs\\nprompts to imitate human feedback using LLMs APIs.\\nOpposite to constitutional AI, AlpacaFarm injects noise\\nin feedback to replicate human mistakes. Self-Align [93]\\nprompts the LLM with ICL examples, instructing the LLM\\nabout what the response should contain to be considered\\nuseful and ethical. The same LLM is later fine-tuned with the\\nnew dataset.\\nAligning with Prompts: LLMs can be steered with prompts\\nto generate desirable responses without training [164],\\n[165]. The self-correction prompting in [165] concatenates\\ninstructions and CoT with questions, guiding the model to\\nanswer its instruction following strategy to ensure moral\\nsafety before the actual answer. This strategy is shown to\\nreduce the harm in generated responses significantly.\\nRed-Teaming/Jailbreaking/Adversarial Attacks: LLMs\\nexhibit harmful behaviors, hallucinations, leaking personal\\ninformation, and other shortcomings through adversarial\\nprobing. The models are susceptible to generating harmful\\nresponses even though they are aligned for safety [166],\\n[167]. Red-teaming is a common approach to address\\nillicit outputs, where the LLMs are prompted to generate\\nharmful outputs [167], [168]. The dataset collected through\\nred-teaming is used to fine-tune models for safety. While\\nred-teaming largely relies on human annotators, another\\nwork [169] red-team LLMs to find prompts that lead to\\nharmful outputs of other LLMs.', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 13}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 15\\n4. Continue Pre-Training: Although fine-tuning boosts a\\nmodel’s performance, it leads to catastrophic forgetting of\\npreviously learned information. Concatenating fine-tuning data\\nwith a few randomly selected pre-training samples in every\\niteration avoids network forgetting [170], [141]. This is also\\neffective in adapting LLMs for cases where fine-tuning data is\\nsmall and the original capacity is to be maintained. Prompt-\\nbased continued pre-training (PCP) [171] trains the model\\nwith text and instructions related to tasks and then finally\\ninstruction-tunes the model for downstream tasks.\\n5. Sample Efficiency: While fine-tuning data is generally\\nmany-fold smaller than the pre-training data, it still has to\\nbe large enough for acceptable performance [16], [92], [18]\\nand requires proportional computing resources. To study the\\neffects on performance with less data, existing literature [172],\\n[173] finds that the models trained on lesser data can out-\\nperform models trained with more data. In [172], 25% of\\nthe total downstream data is found enough for state-of-the-\\nart performance. Selecting coreset-based 0.5% of the total\\ninstruction-tuning data improves the model performance by\\n2% in [173], as compared to the complete data tuning. Less\\nis more for alignment (LIMA) [174] uses only 1000 carefully\\ncreated demonstrations to fine-tune the model and has achieved\\ncomparable performance to GPT-4.\\nC. Increasing Context Window\\nLLMs are trained with limited context windows due to\\nexpensive attention and high memory requirements. A model\\ntrained on limited sequence lengths fails to generalize to\\nunseen lengths at inference time [175], [49]. Alternatively,\\nLLMs with ALiBi [65] positional encodings can perform zero-\\nshot length extrapolation. However, ALiBi has less expres-\\nsive power [66] and inferior performance on multiple bench-\\nmarks [46], and many LLMs use RoPE positional embedding\\nthat is unable to perform zero-shot extrapolation. A larger con-\\ntext length has benefits such as a better understanding of longer\\ndocuments, more samples in in-context learning, execution\\nof bigger reasoning processes, etc. Expanding context length\\nduring fine-tuning is slow, inefficient, and computationally\\nexpensive [49]. Therefore, researchers employ various context\\nwindow extrapolation techniques discussed below.\\nPosition Interpolation: Rather than extrapolating, [49] shows\\nthat interpolating position encodings within the pre-trained\\ncontext window are more effective. The work demonstrates\\nthat only 1000 steps of fine-tuning are enough to achieve better\\nresults on larger windows without performance loss compared\\nto the original context size. Giraffe [46] uses power scaling in\\nRoPE, and YaRN [47] proposed NTK-aware interpolation.\\nEfficient Attention Mechanism: Dense global attention is\\none of the major constraints in training larger context win-\\ndow LLMs. Using efficient attention variants, such as local,\\nsparse, and dilated attention, reduces the computation cost\\nsignificantly. LongT5 [48] proposes transient global attention\\n(TGlobal), applying attention to local and global tokens (win-\\ndowing token averaging). The model replaces attention in\\nT5 [10] with TGlobal attention, pre-trains the model on 4098\\nsequence length, fine-tunes on larger window sizes, as largeas 16k, and improves task performance with longer inputs.\\nThis shows the extrapolation ability of TGlobal attention\\nwith only fine-tuning. COLT5 [176] uses two branches, one\\nwith lightweight and the other with heavyweight attention\\nand feed-forward layers. All tokens are processed from the\\nlightweight branch, and only important tokens are routed to\\nthe heavyweight branch. LongNet [177] replaces standard\\nattention with dilated attention, expanding sequence length to 1\\nbillion tokens. LongLoRA [178] proposes shift-short attention,\\nused during fine-tuning to reduce dense attention costs, while\\nthe model during inference can use dense attention and achieve\\nsimilar performance as full attention fine-tuning.\\nExtrapolation without Training: LM-Infinite [175] and par-\\nallel context windows (PCW) [179] show length extrapolation\\nis possible using pre-trained LLMs. LM-Infinite suggested Λ-\\nshaped attention applied within the original context window\\nlimits. Likewise, PCW chunks larger inputs into the pre-trained\\ncontext lengths and applies the same positional encodings to\\neach chunk.\\nD. Augmented LLMs\\nLLMs are capable of learning from the examples concate-\\nnated with the input, known as context augmentation, in-\\ncontext learning (ICL), or few-shot prompting. They show\\nexcellent generalization to unseen tasks with few-shot prompt-\\ning, enabling LLMs to answer queries beyond the capacity\\nacquired during training [6], [55]. These emergent abilities\\nallow for adapting the model without fine-tuning - a costly\\nprocess. Aside from this, hallucination, producing inaccurate,\\nunsafe, or factually incorrect responses, is common for LLMs,\\nwhich is avoided by augmenting contextual data. While the\\nuser can provide in-context samples in the query [54], [32],\\nhere we specifically refer to the methods that access external\\nstorage programmatically, calling them augmented LLMs.\\nThe literature suggests various external memory designs to\\naugment LLMs, long-term [180], [181], [182], [183], short-\\nterm [184], symbolic [185], and non-symbolic [186], [187].\\nThe memory can be maintained in different formats such as\\ndocuments, vectors, or databases. A few systems maintain\\nintermediate memory representations to retain information\\nacross multiple iterations [183], [181], while others extract\\nimportant information from the datasets and save it in memory\\nfor recall [188]. The memory read and write operations are\\nperformed either with or without LLMs cooperation [181],\\n[189], [183], [190], acting as a feedback signal in [184]. We\\ndiscuss different types of augmented LLMs below.\\n1. Retrieval Augmented LLMs: LLMs may have limited\\nmemory and outdated information, leading to inaccurate\\nresponses. Retrieving relevant information from external\\nup-to-date storage enables the LLMs to accurately answer\\nwith references and utilize more information. With retrieval\\naugmentation, smaller models have been shown to perform\\nat par with larger models. For instance, the 11B model can\\nbecome competitive to 540B PaLM in [25] and 7.5B to 280B\\nGopher in [182]. Retrieval augmented language modeling\\n(RALM) has two major components, shown in Figure 12,\\nnamely: 1) retriever and 2) language model. In RALM, the', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 14}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 16\\nFig. 12: A flow diagram of Retrieval Augmented LLMs. The\\nretriever extracts a similar context to the input and forwards\\nit to the LLM either in simple language or encoded through\\nFusion-in-Decoder (FiD). Depending on the task, retrieval and\\ngeneration may repeat multiple times.\\nretriever plays a crucial role in driving LLM response, where\\nincorrect information can steer LLMs to false behavior. This\\nleads to the development of various methods to retrieve\\naccurate information and fuse with the query for better\\nperformance.\\nZero-Shot Retrieval Augmentation: This kind of\\naugmentation keeps the original LLM architecture and\\nweights unchanged and uses BM25 [191], nearest neighbors,\\nor frozen pre-trained models like Bert [7] as a retriever. The\\nretrieved information is provided as input to the model for\\nresponse generation, shown to improve performance over\\nLLMs without retrieval [187], [192]. In some scenarios,\\nmultiple retrieval iterations are required to complete the task.\\nThe output generated in the first iteration is forwarded to the\\nretriever to fetch similar documents. Forward-looking active\\nretrieval (FLARE) [186] initially generates the response\\nand corrects the output by retrieving relevant documents\\nif the response contains low-confidence tokens. Similarly,\\nRepoCoder [193] fetches code snippets recursively for code\\ncompletion.\\nTraining with Retrieval Augmentation: To reduce failures in\\nretrieval augmentation generation (RAG), researchers train or\\nfine-tune retrievers and LLMs with a retrieval augmentation\\npipeline. We discuss the literature below based on their focus\\non the respective training processes of the pipeline.\\nTraining LLM: Retrieval-enhanced transformer\\n(RETRO) [182] shows pre-training smaller LLMs with\\nRAG pipeline outperforms larger LLMs, such as GPT-3\\ntrained without RAG. RETRO uses a 2-trillion token subset\\nof MassiveText as a database. The retrieval pipeline divides\\nthe input query into subsets and retrieves relevant chunks\\nfrom the database for each subset, encoded together with\\ninput intermediate representations for generating tokens. It\\nuses cross-chunked attention to attend to previous chunks\\nauto-regressively. A study on RETRO [194] shows models\\npre-trained without RAG but fine-tuned using RAG lack the\\nperformance gains obtained by pre-training with RAG.\\nTraining Retriever: Quality of responses generated byLLMs is highly dependent on the in-context examples.\\nTherefore, [195], [196], [197], [198] train retrievers to\\nretrieve accurate few-shot samples while keeping the LLM\\nfrozen for generation. Retrieved samples are ranked to\\nbuild ground-truth data to train retrievers with contrastive\\nlearning in [195], [197]. RoBERTa is trained for downstream\\ntasks in [196] for ICL samples retrieval. REPLUG [198]\\ntrains the retriever with supervised signals from the frozen\\nLLM-generated outputs.\\nTraining Retriever and LLM: Further benefits are achieved\\nby training both the retriever and the model in [25], [199],\\n[200]. In this case, the error propagates back to the retriever,\\nupdating both the language model and the retriever. While\\nmasked language modeling (MLM) is a common pre-\\ntraining objective [25], [200], retrieval pre-trained transformer\\n(RPT) [199] used document chunk prediction as a pre-training\\nobjective for long text modeling.\\nEncoded Context Augmentation: Concatenating retrieved\\ndocuments with the query becomes infeasible as the sequence\\nlength and sample size grow. Encoding the context and fusing\\nit with the decoder (Fusion-in-Decoder) using cross-attention\\nmakes it possible to augment more samples without increasing\\ncomputation costs significantly [201], [182], [199], [25].\\nWeb Augmented: Locally stored memory, but external to\\nLLM, has limited information. However, a large amount of\\ninformation is available on the internet, which gets updated\\nregularly. Rather than storing information locally, various\\nmethods retrieve query-related context through a web search\\nand forward it to LLMs [202], [203], [155].\\n2. Tool Augmented LLMs: While RAG relies on the re-\\ntriever to provide context to the LLM to answer queries, tool\\naugmented LLMs capitalize on the reasoning abilities of LLMs\\nto iteratively plan by dividing tasks into sub-tasks, selecting\\nnecessary tools, and taking actions to complete the task [204],\\n[205], [206], [27]. A generic pipeline of tool-augmented LLMs\\nis shown in Figure 13, where different modules in Figure 13\\nare selected in a loop until the task completion.\\nZero-Shot Tool Augmentation: LLMs in-context learning and\\nreasoning abilities enable them to interact with tools without\\ntraining. Automatic reasoning and tool-use (ART) [206] builds\\na task library with demonstrations of reasoning steps and\\ncalling external tools. It retrieves similar task examples and\\nprovides the context to the LLM for inference. Aside from\\nthis, [207] shows tool documentation is enough to teach LLMs\\nto use tools without demonstrations. RestGPT [208] integrates\\nLLMs with RESTful APIs by decomposing tasks into planning\\nand API selection steps. The API selector understands the\\nAPI documentation to select a suitable API for the task\\nand plan the execution. ToolkenGPT [209] uses tools as\\ntokens by concatenating tool embeddings with other token\\nembeddings. During inference, the LLM generates the tool\\ntokens representing the tool call, stops text generation, and\\nrestarts using the tool execution output.\\nTraining with Tool Augmentation: LLMs are trained to\\ninteract with diverse tools, enhancing planning abilities to\\novercome the limitations of zero-shot tool augmentation [210],\\n[27], [211], [212].

The tool augmented LLMs utilize\\ndifferent modules iteratively, such as retriever, tool execution,\\nread-write to memory, feedback, etc., depending on the task.\\ninformation retrieval from API documentation. It uses self-\\ninstruct [19] data generation pipeline with GPT-4 by providing\\nin-context examples retrieved from API documentation. Tool\\naugmented language model (TALM) [27] fine-tunes T5 [10]\\nfor tool use with a self-play approach, where it iteratively\\ncompletes tool manipulation tasks and includes them back in\\nthe training set. ToolLLM [212] collects 16k APIs from Rapi-\\ndAPI. It samples APIs from the list to generate an instruction-\\ntuning dataset using ChatGPT in single-tool and multi-tool\\nscenarios. For high-quality datasets, ToolLLM suggested a\\ndepth-first search-based decision tree (DFSDT) method to\\ngenerate ground-truths with diverse reasoning and planning.\\nMultimodal Tool Augmentation: The compositional reasoning\\ncapacity of LLMs allows them to manipulate tools in mul-\\ntimodal settings [204], [205], [213]. Following the pipeline\\nshown in Figure 13, the LLM outlines a plan, generally\\nexecuting in a sequence: Plan →Tool selection →Exe-\\ncute→Inspect →Generate, to respond to the user query.\\nHere, the database of tools is rich in modalities, including\\ntext, images, etc. Many of the multimodal tool augmentation\\nsystems employ multimodal LLMs [31], [214], [213], [205],\\nwhile others utilize single modality LLMs and generate a\\nplan on using different modality tools to solve multimodal\\nqueries [215].\\nE. LLMs-Powered Agents\\nAI agents are autonomous entities, capable of planning,\\ndecision-making, and performing actions to achieve complex\\ngoals. In the older days, AI agents were rule-based, de-\\nsigned for narrow tasks, and had limited capabilities, such\\nas Clippy [216] and Deep Blue [217]. In contrast to this,the LLMs capabilities to respond to dynamic scenarios have\\nmade it possible to incorporate them in diverse applications,\\nincluding LLMs-powered agents [213], [205], where LLMs\\nbehave as the brain of agents. LLMs have been incorporated in\\nweb agents [155], [156], coding agents [218], tool agents [27],\\n[212], embodied agents [26], and conversational agents [184],\\nwithout requiring fine-tuning or minimal in some cases. Be-\\nlow we summarize the research in LLMs-based autonomous\\nagents. For a more detailed discussion, please refer to [219],\\n[220].\\nLLMs Steering Autonomous Agents: LLMs are the cognitive\\ncontrollers of the autonomous agents. They generate plans,\\nreason about tasks, incorporate memory to complete tasks\\nand adapt the outline depending on the feedback from the\\nenvironment. Depending on the acquired capabilities of LLMs,\\nmany methods fine-tune, propose a better prompting approach,\\nor utilize different modules to enhance agents’ performance.\\nModules and strategies employed in autonomous agents are\\nbriefly discussed below.\\nPlanning and Reasoning: Completing a complex task requires\\nhuman-like logical thinking, planning necessary steps, and\\nreasoning current and future directions. Prompting methods\\nlike chain-of-thoughts [98], tree-of-thoughts [100], and self-\\nconsistency [99] are central to agents, eliciting LLMs to\\nreason its actions and choose among different paths for task\\ncompletion. When LLMs are prompted with task description\\nand sequence of actions, they can accurately generate plan\\nactions without any fine-tuning [221]. Reasoning via planning\\n(RAP) [222] incorporates a re-purposed LLM as a world\\nmodel to reason about future outcomes and explore alternative\\npaths for task completion. Retroformer [223] uses a retro-\\nspective LLM to improve main LLM planning and reasoning\\ncapabilities by providing helpful task cues.\\nFeedback: LLMs in open-loop systems generate plans and\\nassume that the agent will complete it successfully. However,\\nthe actual scenario is different with failures and variable\\nresponses from the environment. To correctly complete tasks,\\nmany methods use LLMs in closed-loop where the action\\nresponse is provided as feedback to the LLMs to re-assess\\nand update the plan as required [224], [225], [226], [184].\\nAnother direction of research exploits LLMs as reward func-\\ntions to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies instead of\\nhumans [227].\\nMemory: LLMs can learn from the context provided in the\\nprompt. In addition to internal memory, various systems em-\\nploy external memory to save the response history. Reflex-\\nion [184] maintains an episodic memory to use previous re-\\nsponses as feedback to improve future decision-making. Retro-\\nformer [223] improves its responses by employing short-term\\nand long-term memory, where short-term memory contains\\nrecent responses and long-term memory keeps summarized\\nfailed attempts to add in the prompt as reflection.\\nMulti-Agents Systems: LLMs can play user-defined roles and\\nbehave like a specific domain expert. In multi-agent systems,\\neach LLM is assigned a unique role, simulating human behav-\\nior and collaborating with other agents to complete a complex\\ntask [218], [228].\\nLLMs in Physical Environment: LLMs are good at', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 16}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 18\\ninstruction-following, however, utilizing them for physically\\ngrounded tasks requires adaptation, as they lack real-world\\nknowledge. This could lead to generating illogical responses\\nfor a particular physical situation [229], [26]. SayCan [229]\\nmake LLMs aware of the available low-level task operations.\\nLLM (Say) builds a high-level plan to complete the task and\\na learned affordance function (Can) explores the possibility\\nof executing the plan in the real world. SayCan uses RL to\\ntrain the language-conditioned affordance function. PaLM-E\\nenables the LLM to solve grounded tasks by training multi-\\nmodal LLM feeding inputs directly from the sensors.\\nManipulation: In the area of manipulation [225], [230], LLMs\\nenhance a robot’s dexterity and adaptability, excelling in tasks\\nlike object recognition, grasping, and collaboration. They\\nanalyze visual and spatial information to determine the most\\neffective approach to interact with objects.\\nNavigation: LLMs enhance a robot’s ability to navigate com-\\nplex environments with precision and adaptability [231], [232],\\n[233], [234]. They generate feasible paths and trajectories for\\nrobots, accounting for intricate environmental details [235].\\nThis ability is valuable in scenarios requiring precise and\\ndynamically adaptable navigation in environments like ware-\\nhouses, transport, healthcare facilities, and residences.\\nF . Efficient LLMs\\nDeploying LLMs in production is expensive. Reducing their\\nrunning costs while preserving performance is an appealing\\narea of research. This section summarizes the approaches\\nsuggested to enhance LLMs efficiency.\\n1. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuning LLMs\\nwith tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, such as\\nGPT-3 (175B), BLOOM (176B), MT-NLG (540B), etc., is\\ncomputationally-intensive and time-consuming. To avoid com-\\nplete model fine-tuning, numerous parameter-efficient fine-\\ntuning (PEFT) techniques [40], [236], [41], [38], [39] try\\nto achieve acceptable model fine-tuning performance at re-\\nduced costs. As compared to full fine-tuning [237], PEFT\\nperforms better in low-resource setups, achieves comparable\\nperformance on medium-resource scenarios, and performs\\nworse than full fine-tuning under high-resource availability. An\\noverview of different PEFT approaches is shown in Figure 14.\\nAdapter Tuning: Adds a few trainable parameters within the\\ntransformer block. The adapter layer is a sequence of feature\\ndownscaling, non-linearity, and upscaling [101]. Variants of\\nadapter tuning inject adapter layers sequentially [101] and in\\nparallel [38], whereas the mixture of adapter (AdaMix) [238]\\nemploys multiple adapter modules in a single layer. AdaMix\\nroutes input instances randomly to one of the multiple down-\\nscale and upscale modules. The mixture of adapters is av-\\neraged out for inference to avoid additional latency. Low-\\nRank Adaptation (LoRA) [239] learns low-rank decomposed\\nmatrices to freeze original weights. Learned weights are fused\\nwith the original weights for inference, avoiding latency.\\nPrompt Tuning: Prompting is an effective way to adapt a\\npre-trained LLM for the downstream task. However, manual\\nprompts bring uncertainty in the model’s prediction, where a\\nchange in a single word drops the performance [236]. Prompttuning alleviates this problem by fine-tuning only 0.001%-\\n3% additional parameters [240]. It concatenates trainable\\nprompt parameters with the model embeddings [236], [40],\\n[240]. Task-specific fixed discrete prompts are concatenated\\nwith input embeddings in [40]. As discrete prompts bring\\ninstability, prompts are encoded through a learnable mapping\\nin P-Tuning [236], naming continuous prompts, which are\\nappended with the discrete prompts. Only the prompt encoder\\nis trainable in the model. In an extension of P-Tuning, contin-\\nuous prompts are concatenated with each layer of the network\\nin [240]. Progressive prompts [241] avoid catastrophic forget-\\nting and transfer previously learned knowledge by sequentially\\nadding trainable prompt embeddings to the previously frozen\\ntask embeddings.\\nPrefix Tuning: A set of trainable task-specific prefix vec-\\ntors are appended to the frozen transformer layers in prefix\\ntuning [41]. The prefix vectors are virtual tokens attended\\nby the context tokens on the right. In addition, adaptive\\nprefix tuning [242] applies a gating mechanism to control the\\ninformation from the prefix and actual tokens.\\nBias Tuning: Fine-tuning only bias terms in small to medium\\ntraining data has been found effective in BitFit [243]. This\\nmethod achieves full fine-tuning performance for tasks with\\nless training data and comparable performance with larger\\ntraining data.\\n2. Quantization: LLMs require extensive computing and\\nmemory for inference. Deploying 175B parameter GPT-3\\nmodel needs at least 5x80GB A100 GPUs and 350GB of\\nmemory to store in FP16 format [44]. Such demanding re-\\nquirements for deploying LLMs make it harder for smaller\\norganizations to utilize them. Model compression is an effec-\\ntive solution but comes at the cost of degrading performance,\\nespecially at large scales greater than 6B. These models exhibit\\nvery large magnitude outliers that do not exist in smaller\\nmodels [244], making it challenging and requiring specialized\\nmethods for quantizing LLMs [44], [245].\\nPost-Training Quantization: Minimal or no training is re-\\nquired in this type of quantization, without significantly com-\\npromising the model performance. LLM-8-bit [244] uses full-\\nprecision matrix multiplication for weights associated with\\noutlier features and 8-bit for remaining. The lower precision\\nmultiplication outputs are converted to FP-16 and concatenated\\nwith others. The quantized models have homogenous word\\nembeddings, which may degrade their performance. To fix this,\\ntoken-level knowledge distillation is employed in [45] along\\nwith independent quantization scaling factors for each module\\ndue to varying weight distribution. Feature distributions are\\nasymmetric and appear in different channels; outlier suppres-\\nsion [246] shifts and scales per-channel activation distributions\\nfor effective quantization. SmoothQuant [44] quantizes acti-\\nvations and weights to INT8 format by smoothing activations\\nand migrating the quantization difficulty toward weights. It\\nmultiplies the inverse of the smoothing factor with weights,\\nwhich introduces a few outliers in the weights but is easier to\\nquantify than unsmoothed activations. OPTQ [245] uses the\\noptimal brain compression (OBC) [247] algorithm to quantize\\nthe model layer-by-layer and update weights to compensate for\\nquantization error. To improve speed and performance, OPTQ', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 17}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 19\\nFig. 14: Illustration of parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigms, where xis input and his hidden state, figure courtesy [38].\\nParallel adapter and LoRA fall in the adapter tuning category\\nupdates weights in arbitrary order, employs lazy updates, and\\nuses better Cholesky kernels. Outlier-aware weight quantiza-\\ntion (OWQ) [248] uses the OPTQ algorithm for quantization\\nbut assigns higher precision to vulnerable weights, causing\\noutliers and lower precision for others.\\nQuantization-Aware Training: To compensate for perfor-\\nmance degradation, a quantized model is fine-tuned in\\nquantization-aware training (QAT) [249], [250], [251]. Al-\\nphatuning quantizes the model using binary coding quanti-\\nzation (BCQ) [252] and fine-tunes only quantization scaling\\nfactors. This approach improves performance over parameter-\\nefficient fine-tuning of a pre-trained model and then quan-\\ntizing and fine-tuning. Similarly, parameter-efficient and\\nquantization-aware adaptation (PEQA) [253] reduces the pre-\\ncision of fully-connected layers and fine-tunes only quantiza-\\ntion scaling parameters. LLM-QAT [251] generates training\\ndata from the pre-trained network and trains a quantized\\nstudent model with knowledge distillation. QLoRA [250] fine-\\ntunes 4-bit quantized pre-trained LLM with LoRA [239] using\\n4-bit normal float, which shows better performance over 4-bit\\ninteger and float.\\n3. Pruning: Pruning is an alternative approach to quantiza-\\ntion to compress model size, thereby reducing LLMs deploy-\\nment costs significantly. Compared to task-agnostic pruning,\\ntask-specific pruning is easily achievable with good perfor-\\nmance, where a model is fine-tuned on the downstream task\\nand pruned for faster inference. It is possible to prune LLMs\\nfor individual tasks, but the cost of pruning and deploying task-\\nspecific models is high. To overcome this, many structured and\\nunstructured pruning methods for LLMs have been proposed\\nto maintain reasonable performance while shrinking the model\\nsize [254], [42], [255].\\nUnstructured Pruning: This kind of pruning removes less\\nimportant weights without maintaining any structure. Existing\\nLLM pruning methods take advantage of the unique charac-\\nteristics of LLMs, uncommon for smaller models, where a\\nsmall subset of hidden states are activated with large magni-\\ntude [244]. Pruning by weights and activations (Wanda) [254]\\nprunes weights in every row based on importance, calculated\\nby multiplying the weights with the norm of input. The pruned\\nmodel does not require fine-tuning, thereby saving computa-tional costs. Outlier weighed layerwise sparsity (OWL) [256]\\nextends Wanda with non-uniform layer pruning. It shows that\\nthe number of outliers varies for different layers; therefore,\\nthe model should have variable pruning ratios for better\\nperformance for every layer. Contrastive pruning (CAP) [43]\\niteratively prunes the model by training the sparse model\\nusing contrastive loss between pre-trained, fine-tuning, and\\nsnapshots of previous sparse models to learn task-specific and\\ntask-agnostic knowledge.\\nStructured Pruning: Here, the parameters are removed in\\ngroups, rows, columns, or matrices, which speeds up the\\ninference because of effective hardware tensor core utiliza-\\ntion [254]. LLM-Pruner [42] employs a 3-stage structured\\npruning strategy, identifying the groups of hidden states\\ncausing each other to activate during forward-pass, keeping\\nimportant groups and removing less important ones, and fine-\\ntuning the pruned model with LoRA. Sparsity-induced mask\\nlearning (SIMPLE) [257] prunes the network using learnable\\nmasks. Similarly, another method prunes LLMs by learning\\nmasks and removing unimportant rank-1 components of the\\nfactorized weight matrix [255].\\nG. Multimodal LLMs\\nInspired by the success of LLMs in natural language pro-\\ncessing applications, an increasing number of research works\\nare now facilitating LLMs to perceive different modalities\\nof information like image [258], [259], [260], video [261],\\n[262], [263], audio [264], [263], [265], etc.Multimodal LLMs\\n(MLLMs) present substantial benefits compared to standard\\nLLMs that process only text. By incorporating information\\nfrom various modalities, MLLMs can achieve a deeper un-\\nderstanding of context, leading to more intelligent responses\\ninfused with a variety of expressions. Importantly, MLLMs\\nalign closely with human perceptual experiences, leveraging\\nthe synergistic nature of our multisensory inputs to form\\na comprehensive understanding of the world [265], [26].\\nCoupled with a user-friendly interface, MLLMs can offer\\nintuitive, flexible, and adaptable interactions, allowing users\\nto engage with intelligent assistants through a spectrum of\\ninput methods. According to the ways of constructing models,\\ncurrent MLLMs can be generally divided into three streams:', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 18}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 20\\npre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. In this section, we\\nwill discuss more details of these main streams, as well as the\\nimportant application of MLLMs in visual reasoning.\\nPre-training: This stream of MLLMs intends to support differ-\\nent modalities using unified end-to-end models. For instance,\\nFlamingo [258] applies gated cross-attention to fuse vision and\\nlanguage modalities, which are collected from pre-trained and\\nfrozen visual encoder and LLM, respectively. Moreover, BLIP-\\n2 [259] proposes a two-stage strategy to pre-train a Querying\\nTransformer (Q-Former) for the alignment between vision\\nand language modalities: in the first stage, vision-language\\nrepresentation learning is bootstrapped from a frozen visual\\nencoder; and in the second stage, a frozen LLM bootstraps\\nvision-to-language generative learning for zero-shot image-\\nto-text generation. Similarly, MiniGPT-4 [266] also deploys\\npre-trained and frozen ViT [267], Q-Former and Vicuna\\nLLM [148], while only a linear projection layer needs to be\\ntrained for vision and language modalities alignment.\\nFine-tuning: Derived from instruction tuning [16] for NLP\\ntasks [20], [16], [92], researchers are now fine-tuning pre-\\ntrained LLMs using multimodal instructions. Following this\\nmethod, LLMs can be easily and effectively extended as\\nmultimodal chatbots [266], [260], [29] and multimodal task\\nsolvers [268], [30], [269]. The key issue of this stream of\\nMLLMs is to collect multimodal instruction-following data for\\nfine-tuning [58]. To address this issue, the solutions of bench-\\nmark adaptation [268], [270], [271], self-instruction [19], [31],\\n[272], and hybrid composition [273], [269] are employed,\\nrespectively. To mitigate the gap between the original language\\nmodality and additional modalities, the learnable interface is\\nintroduced to connect different modalities from frozen pre-\\ntrained models. Particularly, the learnable interface is expected\\nto work in a parameter-efficient tuning manner: e.g., LLaMA-\\nAdapter [274] applies an efficient transformer-based adapter\\nmodule for training, and LaVIN [273] dynamically learns\\nthe multimodal feature weights using a mixture-of-modality\\nadapter. Different from the learnable interface, the expert mod-\\nels can directly convert multimodalities into language: e.g.,\\nVideoChat-Text [261] incorporates Whisper [275], a speech\\nrecognition expert model, to generate the captions of given\\nvideos for the understanding of following LLMs.\\nPrompting: Different from the fine-tuning technique that\\ndirectly updates the model parameters given task-specific\\ndatasets, the prompting technique provides certain context,\\nexamples, or instructions to the model, fulfilling specialized\\ntasks without changing the model parameters. Since prompting\\ncan significantly reduce the need for large-scale multimodal\\ndata, this technique is widely used to construct MLLMs.\\nParticularly, to solve multimodal Chain of Thought (CoT)\\nproblems [98], LLMs are prompted to generate both the rea-\\nsoning process and the answer given multimodal inputs [276].\\nOn this front, different learning paradigms are exploited in\\npractice: for example, Multimodal-CoT [276] involves two\\nstages of rationale generation and answer inference, where the\\ninput of the second stage is a combination of the original input\\nand the output of the first stage; and CoT-PT [277] applies\\nboth prompt tuning and specific visual bias to generate a chain\\nof reasoning implicitly. In addition to CoT problems, LLMscan also be prompted with multimodal descriptions and tools,\\neffectively dividing complex tasks into sub-tasks [278], [279].\\nVisual Reasoning Application: Recent visual reasoning sys-\\ntems [280], [281], [205], [282] tend to apply LLMs for better\\nvisual information analysis and visual-language integration.\\nDifferent from previous works [283], [284] that rely on limited\\nVQA datasets and small-scale neural networks, current LLM-\\naided methods offer benefits of stronger generalization ability,\\nemergent ability, and interactivity [58]. To realize visual rea-\\nsoning with the help of LLMs, prompting and fine-tuning tech-\\nniques can also be utilized: for example, PointClip V2 [281]\\napplies LLMs to generate 3D-specific prompts, which are\\nencoded as textual features and then combined with visual\\nfeatures for 3D recognition; and GPT4Tools [31] employs\\nLoRA [239] to fine-tune LLMs following tool-related instruc-\\ntions. Serving as a controller [282], decision maker [285], or\\nsemantics refiner [280], [286], LLMs significantly facilitates\\nthe progress of visual reasoning research.\\nH. Summary and Discussion\\n1. Architecture: Due to the gigantic scale of LLMs, minor\\nchanges in architecture and training strategies have a big\\nimpact on performance and stability. Here, we summarize key\\narchitectural modules used in various LLMs, leading to better\\nperformance, reduced training time and memory, and better\\ntraining stability.\\nLayer Normalization: is found to have a significant effect\\non the performance and training stability of LLMs. Pre-\\nnorm, that is normalizing inputs rather than outputs, is more\\ncommon among LLMs stabilizing the training [6], [125],\\n[103]. BLOOM [13] and AlexaTM [120] utilize an additional\\nlayer normalization before embedding layer to stabilize the\\ntraining of large-scale models, while the model’s zero-shot\\ngeneralization ability can be negatively impacted [13]. How-\\never, another study [33] finds that pre-norm degrades fine-\\ntuned model performance as compared to post-norm, and there\\nare no stability benefits of pre-norm beyond the 100B scale.\\nTherefore, GLM-130B [33] used deep-norm which is a variant\\nof post-norm for better downstream task performance after\\nfine-tuning.\\nPositional Encoding: effect performance and training stability\\nof LLMs like other building blocks of a model. BLOOM [13]\\nfinds ALiBi outperforming learned and rotary positional en-\\ncodings. Contrary to this, GLM-130B [33] identifies rotary\\npositional encoding better than ALiBi. So, there is no conclu-\\nsion in literature about the positional encodings yet.\\nParallel Attention: where attention and feed-forward layers\\nare parallel to each other rather than sequential in transformer\\nblock has shown to reduce training time by 15%. There is no\\nevidence of performance drop due to this change in literature\\nand used by the models PaLM [15], GPT-NeoX [113], and\\nCodeGen [129].\\nMulti-Query Attention has shared key and value attention\\nheads in a transformer block while query attention heads are\\nprojected as usual. This reduces memory usage and speeds\\nup sampling in autoregressive decoding. No performance\\ndegradation has been observed with this change and makes', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 19}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 21\\nthe training efficient allowing larger batch sizes. Multi-query\\nattention is used in [15], [131].\\nMixture of Experts: allows easily scaling model to trillion\\nof parameters [128], [116]. Only a few experts are activated\\nduring the computation making them compute-efficient. The\\nperformance of MoE models is better than the dense models\\nfor the same amount of data and requires less computation\\nduring fine-tuning to achieve performance similar to the dense\\nmodels as discussed in [116]. MoE architectures are less\\nprone to catastrophic forgetting, therefore are more suited for\\ncontinual learning [128]. Extracting smaller sub-models for\\ndownstream tasks is possible without losing any performance,\\nmaking MoE architecture hardware-friendly [128].\\nSparse vs Dense Activated: GPT-3 [6] uses sparse trans-\\nformers [67] whereas GLaM [116] and PanGu-P[128] use\\nMoE [117] architecture to lower computational costs and in-\\ncrease the model size and capacity. According to the literature,\\nsparse modules do not degrade the model’s performance [67].\\nHowever, more experiments are required to verify this state-\\nment.\\n2. Training Strategies: Training models at a huge scale\\nrequire tricks to reduce training costs, avoid loss divergence\\nand achieve better performance. We summarize and discuss\\nsome of these key tricks used in different LLMs.\\nMixed Precision: is a famous method for LLMs to reduce\\nmemory usage and improve training efficiency. In mixed\\nprecision, forward and backward passes are performed in\\nFP16 format whereas optimizer states and master weights are\\nkept in FP32 format [115]. A drawback associated with this\\nformat change is training instability due to a smaller value\\nrange resulting in loss spikes [33]. An alternative to FP16\\nis BF16 which has a comparatively larger range and performs\\nsome precision-sensitive operations like gradient accumulation\\nand softmax in FP32 [13]. BF16 has better performance and\\ntraining stability but uses more memory and is supported on\\nspecific hardware, for example, A100 GPUs. Therefore, its\\nadoption in LLMs is limited.\\nTraining Instability: is a common issue in LLMs where loss\\ndivergence or spiking is observed multiple times during train-\\ning. This happens in the presence of gradient clipping [15].\\nTo mitigate this problem, many approaches suggest restarting\\ntraining from an earlier checkpoint [15], [33], [116], skipping\\n200-500 earlier data batches at the point of divergence in [15]\\nand re-shuffling batches in [116]. The embedding layer gradi-\\nent shrink proves to further stabilize the training as its gradient\\nnorm is significantly larger than the other layers [33]. Another\\nsuggestion to improve training stability for larger models is not\\nto use biases in dense and norm layers as in [15].\\nWeight Initialization: plays a significant role in model con-\\nvergence and training stability. GPT-NeoX [113] initializes\\nfeed-forward layers before residuals with2\\nL√\\ndas in [142] and\\nother layers with small initialization scheme [287]. This avoids\\nactivations growing exponentially with the increasing depth.\\nMT-NLG [112] found higher variance for weight initialization\\nleads to unstable training, hence validating small initialization\\nscheme [287]. Various models perform random weight ini-\\ntialization which can cause bad initialization, Galactica [137]\\nsuggests a longer warmup to negate the effect.Learning Rate: is important for stable training. It is suggested\\nto use a lower value [13], [15], [122] with warmup and decay\\n(cosine or linear). Usually, the learning rate is within the\\nrange 1e−4to8e−4. Moreover, MT-NLG (530B) [112] and\\nGPT-NeoX (20B) [113] suggest interpolating learning rates\\nbased on the model size using the GPT-3 [6] models ranging\\nbetween 13B and 175B. This avoids tuning the learning rate\\nhyperparameter.\\nTraining Parallelism: 3D parallelism, a combination of data,\\npipeline and tensor parallelism, is the most utilized training\\nparallelism approach in LLMs [33], [15], [14], [13], [112],\\n[110], [107]. In addition to the 3D parallelism, BLOOM [13]\\nuses zero optimizer [37] to shard optimizer states. PanGu-\\nα[103] and PanGu- Σ[128] go beyond the 3D parallelism and\\napply 5D parallelism which additionally contains optimizer\\nparallelism and rematerialization.\\nMode Switching: adds task-related tokens at the beginning\\nof the text during training. These tokens refer to the natural\\nlanguage understanding and natural language generation tasks\\nwhich are shown to improve the downstream task performance\\nin [123], [122], [120]. During fine-tuning and inference, tokens\\nare appended based on the downstream tasks.\\nControllable Text Generation: Generating credible and con-\\ntrolled text from a pre-trained model is challenging. GPT-\\n3 [6] and other LLMs use in-context learning to control\\ngenerated text. While in-context learning helps in controlling\\nthe generated text, ERNIE 3.0 Titan [35] suggests using\\nadversarial loss to rank its generated text for credibility and\\nsoft prompts such as genre, topic, keywords, sentiment, and\\nlength for better control on generated text.\\n3. Supervised Models vs Generalized Models: Although\\ngeneralized models are capable of performing diverse tasks\\nwith good performance they have not yet outperformed models\\ntrained in supervised settings. The supervised trained models\\nare still state-of-the-art in various NLP tasks by a large margin\\nas shown in [6], [15], [18].\\n4. Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot: LLMs perform well in zero-\\nshot and few-shot settings. But the performance difference\\nbetween zero-shot and few-shot is large for pre-trained mod-\\nels [6], [15], naming LLMs as meta-learners [6]. LLMs zero-\\nshot evaluations underperform unsupervised methods in neural\\nmachine translation [6]. The literature shows pre-training is not\\nenough for good zero-shot performance [15], [16]. To improve\\nthe zero-shot performance the literature suggests using in-\\nstruction fine-tuning that improves the zero-shot performance\\nsignificantly and outperforms baselines. Instruction fine-tuning\\nhas also been shown to improve zero-shot generalization to\\nunseen tasks. Another model Flan-PaLM [16] unlocks zero-\\nshot reasoning with CoT training.\\n5. Encoder vs Decoder vs Encoder-Decoder: Traditionally,\\nthese architectures perform well for different tasks, for exam-\\nple, encoder-only for NLU tasks, decoder-only for NLG, and\\nencoder-decoder for sequence2sequence modeling. Encoder-\\nonly models are famous for smaller models such as Bert [7],\\nRoBERTa [288], etc, whereas LLMs are either decoder-\\nonly [6], [113], [13] or encoder-decoder [10], [11], [120].\\nWhile decoder-only models are good at NLG tasks, various\\nLLMs, PaLM [15], OPT [14], GPT-3 [6], BLOOM [13],', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 20}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 22\\nLLaMA [145], are decoder-only models with significant per-\\nformance gains on both NLU and NLG tasks. In contradiction\\nto this, T5 [10] and UL2 [123] identify encoder-decoder\\nmodels out-performing decoder-only models. In another study,\\nPaLM [15] finds increasing the size of decoder-only models\\ncan reduce the performance gap between decoder-only and\\nencoder-decoder architectures.\\nAlthough decoder-only architectures have become a trend for\\nLLMs, many recently proposed approaches [123], [120] use\\nmode-switching tokens in text with encoder-decoder architec-\\ntures to enable task-specific modes. Similarly, CodeT5+ [34]\\nuses an encoder-decoder architecture with multiple training\\nobjectives for different tasks, activating the encoder, decoder,\\nor both according to the tasks. These variations in architecture\\nand training objectives allow a model to perform well in differ-\\nent settings. Because of this dynamic configuration, the future\\nof LLMs can be attributed to encoder-decoder architectures.\\nIV. M ODEL CONFIGURATIONS\\nWe provide different statistics of pre-trained and instruction-\\ntuned models in this section. This includes information such as\\npublication venue, license type, model creators, steps trained,\\nparallelism, etc in Table III and Table IV. Architecture details\\nof pre-trained LLMs are available in Table V. Providing\\nthese details for instruction-tuned models is unnecessary\\nbecause it fine-tunes pre-trained models for instruction\\ndatasets. Hence, architectural details are the same as the\\nbaselines. Moreover, optimization settings for various LLMs\\nare available in Table VI and Table VII. We do not include\\ndetails on precision, warmup, and weight decay in Table VII.\\nNeither of these details are important as others to mention\\nfor instruction-tuned models nor provided by the papers.\\nV. D ATASETS AND EVALUATION\\nGenerating training and evaluation datasets is expensive\\nbecause of the large-scale data demand of LLMs. Hence,\\ndatasets for training and benchmarking these models are topics\\nof key importance. A summary of datasets commonly used by\\nLLMs is provided next.\\nA. Training Datasets\\nThe performance of LLMs largely depends on the training\\ndata’s quality, size, and diversity. Preparing training datasets\\nof high quality at a large scale is laborious. Researchers\\nhave suggested various pre-training and fine-tuning datasets\\nto enhance LLMs capabilities. We summarize these efforts\\nin Table VIII. While numerous training datasets are available\\nin the literature, we cover the most widely used ones in our\\nsummary.\\nB. Evaluation Datasets and Tasks\\nThe evaluation of LLMs is important in gauging their\\nproficiency and limitations. This process measures the model’s\\nability to comprehend, generate, and interact with human\\nlanguage across a spectrum of tasks. Evaluating a languagemodel (LM) is divided into two broader categories: 1) natural\\nlanguage understanding (NLU) and 2) natural language gen-\\neration (NLG). It is emphasized that tasks in NLU and NLG\\nare softly categorized and are often used interchangeably in\\nthe literature.\\nNatural Language Understanding: This task measures the\\nlanguage understanding capacity of LMs. It encompasses\\nmultiple tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification,\\nnatural language inference (NLI), question answering (QA),\\ncommonsense reasoning (CR), mathematical reasoning (MR),\\nreading comprehension (RC), etc.\\nNatural Language Generation: This task assesses the language\\ngeneration capabilities of LLMs by understanding the provided\\ninput context. It includes tasks such as summarization, sen-\\ntence completion, machine translation (MT), dialogue gener-\\nation, etc.\\nNumerous datasets are proposed for each task, evaluating\\nLLMs against different characteristics. To provide an overview\\nof evaluation datasets, we briefly discuss a few famous datasets\\nwithin each category and offer a comprehensive list of datasets\\nin Table IX. Moreover, we show a detailed overview of the\\ntraining datasets and evaluation tasks and benchmarks used\\nby various pre-trained LLMs in Table X and fine-tuned LLMs\\nin Table XI. We also compare the top-performing LLMs in\\nvarious NLP tasks in Table XII.\\n1.

This\\nis due to their inherent ability to understand, generate, and\\nmanipulate human-like text in a contextually relevant man-\\nner. This allows them to perform tasks ranging from simple\\nlanguage translation and question-answering to more complex\\ntasks like summarization, text generation, and even program-\\nming help [421]. The utility of LLMs is further enhanced by\\ntheir ability to adapt to the specific style and tone of the text\\nthey are processing, making the outputs more user-friendly and\\ncontext-aware. In everyday applications, LLMs can be used\\nas personal assistants, helping users draft emails or schedule\\nappointments [422]; they can also be deployed in customer\\nservice to handle common questions; or applied to generate\\ncontent for digital platforms like websites, by creating human-\\nlike text based on given prompts [423]. Moreover, LLMs play\\na crucial role in data analysis, where they can filter large\\nvolumes of text data, summarize key points, and find patterns\\nthat would take humans much longer to identify [424]. Despite\\ntheir wide-ranging applications, it is essential to remember that\\nLLMs, similar to any AI system, are only as good as the data\\nthey have been trained on.\\nMedicine: The application of LLMs in the field of medicine\\nis reshaping healthcare delivery and research. For example,\\nLLMs are increasingly used in clinical decision support sys-\\ntems to provide physicians with evidence-based treatment\\nrecommendations [425], [426], [427]. By analyzing patient\\ndata and medical literature, they can help identify potential\\ndiagnoses, suggest appropriate tests, and recommend optimal\\ntreatment strategies. Moreover, LLMs can also enhance patient\\ninteractions with healthcare systems; e.g., they can be used\\nin chatbot applications [428], [429], [430] to answer patient\\nqueries about symptoms or medications, schedule appoint-\\nments, and even provide essential health advice. For medical\\nresearch, LLMs are used to extract and filter information from\\na considerable amount of medical literature, identify relevant\\nstudies, summarize findings, and even predict future research\\ntrends [431], [432], [433]. For medical education, LLMs can\\nhelp create training materials, generate exam questions, pro-\\nvide detailed explanations of complex medical topics, and offerpersonalized feedback to students [434], [435], [436], [437].\\nThey can also simulate patient interactions, enabling students\\nto practice and improve their clinical skills. At a broader level,\\nLLMs can assist in public health initiatives by analyzing media\\ndata to detect disease outbreaks, monitor public sentiment\\ntowards health policies, and disseminate health information\\nin a clear and understandable manner [438]. When employing\\nLLMs to support public health initiatives, addressing related\\nissues such as data privacy, the necessity for explainability,\\nand the potential risk of propagating biases [439], [440].\\nEducation: The integration of LLMs into the educational\\nsector offers opportunities to enhance learning experiences,\\nteacher support, and educational content development. For\\nstudents, by analyzing their learning styles, performance, and\\npreferences, LLMs can provide customized study materi-\\nals and practice questions to develop personalized learning\\nexperiences [441]. For teachers, LLMs can help to create\\nlesson plans and grade assignments and generate diverse and\\ninclusive educational content, significantly saving more time\\nfor teaching and student interaction [442], [443]. In language\\nlearning, LLMs serve as advanced conversational partners\\ncapable of simulating conversations in multiple languages,\\ncorrecting grammar, enhancing vocabulary, and aiding pronun-\\nciation for the needs of fluency in practice [444]. Furthermore,\\nLLMs improve accessibility in education by providing support\\nfor students with disabilities. They can generate real-time\\ntranscriptions for the hearing impaired, offer reading assistance\\nfor the visually impaired, and simplify complex texts for those\\nwith learning disabilities [440]. As LLMs continue to evolve,\\ntheir applications in education can benefit more students and\\nteachers from different perspectives in practice.\\nScience: Similar to medical applications, LLMs can expedite\\nthe research process by quickly analyzing and summarizing\\nscientific literature. By briefing comprehensible and accessible\\nresearch summaries, LLMs can assist researchers in staying\\nup-to-date with the latest findings, even in fields outside\\ntheir area of expertise [445], [446]. In addition, LLMs can\\naid scientists in formulating new hypotheses and research\\nquestions since their ability to process large-scale datasets\\nallows them to unveil insights that might not be immediately', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 28}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 30\\napparent to human researchers [447]. Moreover, for scientific\\nwriting, LLMs can help researchers draft documents, suggest\\nimprovements, and ensure adherence to specific formatting\\nguidelines [448], [449]. This not only saves time but also\\nimproves the clarity of scientific communication, enabling\\ninterdisciplinary teams to work together more effectively.\\nMaths: In addition to providing mathematical research and\\neducation support, LLMs can assist in solving mathematical\\nproblems by giving step-by-step explanations and guiding\\nusers through complex proofs and calculations. They can\\nhelp identify errors in reasoning or computation and suggest\\ncorrections, serving as an invaluable tool for both learning\\nand verification purposes [450], [451]. LLMs can be employed\\nto check the validity of mathematical proofs, offering a pre-\\nliminary filter before human review. While they are not a\\nsubstitute for the meticulous work of mathematicians, they can\\nhelp simplify the process of proof verification [452], [453].\\nMoreover, LLMs enhance accessibility to mathematics by\\ntranslating complex concepts and findings into understandable\\nlanguage for non-specialists [454], where the gap between\\ntheoretical mathematics and applied contexts such as physics,\\nengineering, and economics can be bridged.\\nLaw: LLMs can assist with the thematic analysis of legal\\ndocuments, including generating initial coding for datasets,\\nidentifying themes, and classifying data according to these\\nthemes. This collaborative effort between legal experts and\\nLLMs has proved to be effective in analyzing legal texts such\\nas court opinions on theft, improving both the efficiency and\\nquality of the research [455]. Additionally, LLMs have been\\nevaluated for their ability to generate explanations of legal\\nterms, focusing on improving factual accuracy and relevance\\nby incorporating sentences from case law. By feeding relevant\\ncase law into the LLM, the augmented models can generate\\nhigher-quality explanations with less factually incorrect infor-\\nmation [456]. Moreover, LLMs can be trained with specialized\\ndomain knowledge to perform legal reasoning tasks [457] and\\nanswer legal questions [458].\\nFinance: LLMs like BloombergGPT [140], trained on ex-\\ntensive proprietary financial datasets, exhibit superior perfor-\\nmance on financial tasks. This indicates the value of domain-\\nspecific training in creating LLMs that can more accurately\\nunderstand and process industry-specific language and con-\\ncepts. The introduction of FinGPT [459] as an open-source\\nmodel offers transparent and accessible resources to develop\\nnovel applications such as robo-advising, algorithmic trading,\\nand low-code solutions, ultimately expanding the capabilities\\nof financial services. Both BloombergGPT and FinGPT show\\nthe adaptability of LLMs to the financial domain, with the\\nformer showing the power of custom datasets and the latter\\nemphasizing a data-centric approach and low-rank adaptation\\ntechniques for customization. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate an\\nability to break down complex financial tasks into actionable\\nplans, enabling end-to-end solutions that were previously\\nunfeasible with a single model [460].\\nRobotics: In robotics research, LLMs have promising applica-\\ntions, such as enhancing human-robot interaction [28], [461],\\n[462], [463], task planning [226], motion planning [235],\\nnavigation [235], [464], object manipulation [225], personal-ized robots [465], etc. LLMs enable robots to understand the\\nenvironment effectively and generate plans to complete tasks\\ncollaboratively [229], [26]. They can facilitate continuous\\nlearning by allowing robots to access and integrate information\\nfrom a wide range of sources, helping robots acquire new\\nskills, adapt to changes, and refine their paths [213], [222],\\n[223].\\nVII. C HALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\\nLLMs such as GPT-4 and its predecessors have significantly\\nadvanced natural language processing. Nevertheless, they also\\nbring along a set of challenges. The computational cost, adver-\\nsarial robustness, and interpretability are among the technical\\nchallenges that are intrinsic to these models. Furthermore, as\\nthese models are scaled up to handle more complex tasks\\nor to operate in more complex or dynamic environments,\\nnew challenges in scalability, privacy, and real-time processing\\nemerge. On the frontier of foundational research, integrating\\nmulti-modality and the effectiveness of transfer learning are\\nbeing keenly explored. Additionally, the continuous learning\\naspect of these models, which aims to have models that can\\nadapt to new information over time, presents a fresh set of\\nchallenges. These challenges not only underscore the technical\\nintricacies involved but also highlight the broader impact and\\nthe future trajectory of LLMs in real-world applications. The\\nfollowing sections delve into these challenges, shedding light\\non the ongoing and potential efforts to address them.\\nComputational Cost: Training LLMs requires extensive com-\\nputational resources, which increases production costs and\\nraises environmental concerns due to substantial energy con-\\nsumption during large-scale training. Improved performance\\noccurs as computational resources increase, but the rate of\\nimprovement gradually decreases when both the model and\\ndataset size remain fixed, following the power law of dimin-\\nishing returns [466].\\nBias and Fairness: LLMs can inherit and amplify societal\\nbiases in their training data. These biases can manifest in\\nthe model’s outputs, leading to potential ethical and fairness\\nissues [467].\\nOverfitting: Although LLMs possess substantial learning ca-\\npabilities, they are susceptible to overfitting noisy and peculiar\\npatterns within their extensive training data. Consequently,\\nthis may cause them to generate illogical responses [468].\\nThe debate about Memorization vs. Generalization in LLMs\\nis about finding the right balance. Memorization allows the\\nmodel to remember specific details from its training data,\\nensuring it can provide accurate answers to precise questions.\\nHowever, generalization enables the model to make inferences\\nand produce responses for inputs it hasn’t seen before, which\\nis essential for handling various real-world tasks. Striking the\\nright balance is the challenge: too much memorization can\\nlead to overfitting, making the model inflexible and struggling\\nwith new inputs [469].\\nEconomic and Research Inequality: The high cost of training\\nand deploying LLMs may make their development concen-\\ntrated within well-funded organizations, potentially worsening\\neconomic and research inequalities in AI [470].', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 29}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 31\\nReasoning and Planning: Some reasoning and planning tasks,\\neven as seemingly simple as common-sense planning, which\\nhumans find easy, remain well beyond the current capabilities\\nof LLMs evaluated using an assessment framework. This\\nisn’t entirely unexpected, considering that LLMs primarily\\ngenerate text completions based on likelihood and offer no\\nsolid guarantees in terms of reasoning abilities [471].\\nHallucinations: LLMs exhibit \"hallucinations,\" where they\\ngenerate responses that, while sounding plausible, are incorrect\\nor don’t align with the provided information [472]. The\\nhallucination can be categorized into three categories.\\n•Input-conflicting hallucination, wherein LLMs produce\\ncontent that diverges from the input given by users.\\n•Context-conflicting hallucination, where LLMs generate\\ncontent that contradicts information they have generated\\nearlier.\\n•Fact-conflicting hallucination involves LLM’s generation\\nof content that does not align with established world\\nknowledge.\\nPrompt Engineering: Prompts serve as inputs to LLMs, and\\ntheir syntax and semantics play a crucial role in determining\\nthe model’s output. The prompt variations, sometimes counter-\\nintuitive to humans, can result in significant changes in model\\noutput and are addressed through prompt engineering, which\\ninvolves designing natural language queries to guide LLMs\\nresponses effectively [473], [32].\\nLimited Knowledge: Information acquired during pretraining\\nis limited and may become obsolete after some time. Re-\\ntraining the model using updated data is costly. To generate\\nfactually accurate responses people use retrieval augmentation\\npipeline [187]. However, pre-trained models are not trained\\nwith retrieval augmentation generation (RAG) [6], [21],\\nhence, adapting the training pipeline is necessary [182], [25].\\nSafety and Controllability: Using LLMs comes with the risk\\nof generating harmful, misleading, or inappropriate content,\\nwhether by accident or when given specific prompts. Ensuring\\nthese models are safely utilized is a significant concern [474].\\nMulti-Modality: Multi-modal learning, where LLMs are\\ntrained on diverse data like text, images, and videos, aims to\\ncreate models with richer understanding but faces challenges\\nin data alignment, fusion strategies, and higher computational\\ndemands.\\nCatastrophic Forgetting: LLMs are often pre-trained on large\\ndatasets and then fine-tuned on domain-specific data, reducing\\ntraining resources but facing issues like domain adaptation\\nand catastrophic forgetting, which hinders the retention of\\noriginal knowledge when learning new tasks.\\nAdversarial Robustness: Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nhave shown great capabilities in various tasks but are\\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, where slight, deliberate\\ninput alterations can mislead them. Especially with models\\nlike BERT, adversarial fine-tuning can enhance robustness,\\nalthough it sometimes compromises generalization [475].\\nAs LLMs integrate more into complex systems, examining\\ntheir security properties becomes crucial, given the emerging\\nfield of adversarial attacks on LLMs within trustworthy\\nML [476]. This vulnerability is notable in safety-criticaldomains, necessitating robust adversarial evaluation tools to\\nensure LLM reliability [477].\\nInterpretability and Explainability: The \"black-box\" nature\\nof LLMs poses challenges in understanding their decision-\\nmaking, which is crucial for broader acceptance and trust,\\nespecially in sensitive domains. Despite their advanced\\ncapabilities, the lack of insight into their operation limits\\ntheir effectiveness and trustworthiness [478], [479]. Efforts\\nare being made to make LLMs more explainable to promote\\nuser trust and to ensure responsible AI usage. Understanding\\nthe logic behind LLMs’ responses is essential for fostering\\ntrust and ensuring they align with human values and legal\\nstandards.\\nPrivacy Concerns: Privacy concerns in Large Language\\nModels (LLMs) have escalated with their growth in\\ncomplexity and size, particularly around data sharing and\\npotential misuse. There is a risk of malicious content\\ncreation, filter bypass, and data privacy issues, especially in\\ne-commerce, where protecting customer privacy is crucial. If\\nmodels are trained on private data, additional concerns arise\\nif such models are made publicly available. LLMs tend to\\nmemorize phrases from their training sets, which an adversary\\ncould exploit to extract sensitive data, posing a threat to\\npersonal privacy [480], [481].\\nReal-Time Processing: Real-time processing in Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) is pivotal for various applications,\\nespecially with the rising popularity of mobile AI applications\\nand concerns regarding information security and privacy.\\nHowever, LLMs often have hundreds of layers and millions\\nof parameters, which impede real-time processing due to\\nthe high computational demands and limited weight storage\\non hardware platforms, particularly in edge computing\\nenvironments [482]. While certain efforts like MobileBERT\\naim to reduce memory requirements, they still face substantial\\nexecution overhead due to the large number of model layers,\\nleading to high inference latency.\\nLong-Term Dependencies: Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nhave shown considerable progress in understanding and\\ngenerating text, yet they often struggle with preserving\\ncontext and handling long-term dependencies, particularly in\\ncomplex, multi-turn conversations or long documents. This\\nlimitation can lead to incoherent or irrelevant responses.\\nHardware Acceleration: The growth of LLMs presents\\nsignificant hardware challenges due to the increasing\\ncomputational and memory demands associated with training\\nand deploying these models. GPUs have played a crucial role\\nin meeting the hardware requirements for training LLMs,\\nwith the networking industry also evolving to optimize\\nhardware for training workloads. However, the growing size\\nof LLMs, which has been outpacing hardware progress, makes\\nmodel inference increasingly costly. Model quantization is\\na promising approach to bridge the widening gap between\\nLLM size and hardware capacity [483]. Although specialized\\nhardware acceleration like GPUs or TPUs can significantly\\nreduce the computational cost, making real-time applications\\nmore feasible, they may not fully resolve all limitations,\\nnecessitating further advancements in hardware technology.\\nRegulatory and Ethical Frameworks: The rapid', metadata={'source': '/content/a_comprehensive_overview_of_LLM.pdf', 'page': 30}), Document(page_content='PREPRINT 32\\nadvancements in artificial intelligence have given rise to\\nsophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s\\nGPT-4 [146] and Google’s Bard. These developments\\nunderscore the imperative for regulatory oversight to manage\\nthe ethical and social challenges accompanying LLMs’\\nwidespread use [484]. For instance, LLMs can generate\\ncontent that can be used positively or negatively, emphasizing\\nthe need for proactive ethical frameworks and policy measures\\nto guide their responsible use and assign accountability for\\ntheir outputs [485]. Auditing is identified as a promising\\ngovernance mechanism to ensure that AI systems, including\\nLLMs, are designed and deployed ethically, legally, and\\ntechnically robust [486].\\nVIII. C ONCLUSION\\nThis article has reviewed various LLMs, discussing their\\ninteresting aspects. It contributes to summarizing significant\\nfindings in the existing literature and provides a detailed\\nanalysis of the design aspects of LLMs, including architec-\\ntures, datasets, and training pipelines. We identified crucial\\narchitectural components and training strategies employed by\\ndifferent LLMs. These aspects are presented as summaries\\nand discussions throughout the article.

This success of LLMs has led to a large influx of research\\ncontributions in this direction. These works encompass diverse\\ntopics such as architectural innovations, better training strategies,\\ncontext length improvements, fine-tuning, multi-modal LLMs,\\nrobotics, datasets, benchmarking, efficiency, and more. With the\\nrapid development of techniques and regular breakthroughs in\\nLLM research, it has become considerably challenging to perceive\\nthe bigger picture of the advances in this direction. Considering\\nthe rapidly emerging plethora of literature on LLMs, it is\\nimperative that the research community is able to benefit from a\\nconcise yet comprehensive overview of the recent developments\\nin this field. This article provides an overview of the existing\\nliterature on a broad range of LLM-related concepts. Our self-\\ncontained comprehensive overview of LLMs discusses relevant\\nbackground concepts along with covering the advanced topics\\nat the frontier of research in LLMs. This review article is\\nintended to not only provide a systematic survey but also a quick\\ncomprehensive reference for the researchers and practitioners\\nto draw insights from extensive informative summaries of the\\nexisting works to advance the LLM research.\\nIndex Terms —\\nLarge Language Models, LLMs, chatGPT, Augmented LLMs,\\nMultimodal LLMs, LLM training, LLM Benchmarking\\nI.
