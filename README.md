### [Project Heart Disease prediction](https://github.com/luizguilhermedev/myportfolio/tree/main/h-disease-project)
A machine learning model designed to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not.

### [Project Bulldozer price prediction](https://github.com/luizguilhermedev/myportfolio/tree/main/price-prediction-project)
A study to train a machine learning model to predict bulldozer's price

### [Project Dog breed identifier]

### [Project Lunar Lander](https://github.com/luizguilhermedev/myportfolio/tree/main/lunar-lander)
An awesome project from HuggingFace Deep RL, where we've used Deep RL algorithms to make an Agent(AI) learn how to land a Lunar lander in this classic game.

### [Project Rag with Gemma2b](https://github.com/luizguilhermedev/myportfolio/tree/main/gemma2b_rag)
This project explores the potential of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on specific tasks and contexts. We demonstrate this by implementing RAG with LangChain and GEMMA models.
