RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts.\n","\n","**Why is RAG important?**\n","\n","LLMs are a key artificial intelligence (AI) technology powering intelligent chatbots and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. The goal is to create bots that can answer user questions in various contexts by cross-referencing authoritative knowledge sources. Unfortunately, the nature of LLM technology introduces unpredictability in LLM responses. Additionally, LLM training data is static and introduces a cut-off date on the knowledge it has.\n","\n","Known challenges of LLMs include:\n","\n","* Presenting false information when it does not have the answer.\n","* Presenting out-of-date or generic information when the user expects a specific, current response.\n","* Creating a response from non-authoritative sources.\n","* Creating inaccurate responses due to terminology confusion, wherein different training sources use the same terminology to talk about different things.\n","\n","**What are the benefits of Retrieval-Augmented Generation?**\n","RAG technology brings several benefits to an organization's generative AI efforts.\n","\n","**Cost-effective implementation**\n","Chatbot development typically begins using a foundation model. Foundation models (FMs) are API-accessible LLMs trained on a broad spectrum of generalized and unlabeled data. The computational and financial costs of retraining FMs for organization or domain-specific information are high. RAG is a more cost-effective approach to introducing new data to the LLM. It makes generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) technology more broadly accessible and usable.\n","\n","**Current information**\n","Even if the original training data sources for an LLM are suitable for your needs, it is challenging to maintain relevancy. RAG allows developers to provide the latest research, statistics, or news to the generative models. They can use RAG to connect the LLM directly to live social media feeds, news sites, or other frequently-updated information sources. The LLM can then provide the latest information to the users.\n","\n","**Enhanced user trust**\n","RAG allows the LLM to present accurate information with source attribution. The output can include citations or references to sources. Users can also look up source documents themselves if they require further clarification or more detail. This can increase trust and confidence in your generative AI solution.\n","\n","**More developer control**\n","With RAG, developers can test and improve their chat applications more efficiently. They can control and change the LLM's information sources to adapt to changing requirements or cross-functional usage. Developers can also restrict sensitive information retrieval to different authorization levels and ensure the LLM generates appropriate responses. In addition, they can also troubleshoot and make fixes if the LLM references incorrect information sources for specific questions. Organizations can implement generative AI technology more confidently for a broader range of applications.\n","\n","## **How does RAG work?**\n","\n","Without RAG, teh LLM takes the user input and creates a response based on information it was trained on - or what it already know. With RAG, an information retrieval component is introduced that utilizes the user input to first oull information from a new data source.\n","The User query and the relevant information are both given to the LLM. The LLM uses the new knowledge and its training data to create better responses.\n","\n","\n","**Process Overview**\n","\n","**Create external data**\n","\n","The new data outside of the LLM's original training data set is called external data. It can come from multiple data sources, such as a APIs, databases, or document repositories. The data may exist in various formats like files, database records, or long-form text. Another AI technique, called embedding language models, converts data into numerical representations and stores it in a vector database. This process creates a knowledge library that the generative AI models can understand.\n","\n","**Retrieve relevant information**\n","\n","The next step is to perform a relevancy search. The user query is converted to a vector representation and matched with the vector databases. For example, consider a smart chatbot that can answer human resource questions for an organization. If an employee searches, \"How much annual leave do I have?\" the system will retrieve annual leave policy documents alongside the individual employee's past leave record. These specific documents will be returned because they are highly-relevant to what the employee has input. The relevancy was calculated and established using mathematical vector calculations and representations.\n","\n","**Augment the LLM prompt**\n","\n","Next, the RAG model augments the user input (or prompts) by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. This step uses prompt engineering techniques to communicate effectively with the LLM. The augmented prompt allows the large language models to generate an accurate answer to user queries.\n","\n","\n","**Update external data**\n","\n","The next question may be—what if the external data becomes stale? To maintain current information for retrieval, asynchronously update the documents and update embedding representation of the documents. You can do this through automated real-time processes or periodic batch processing. This is a common challenge in data analytics—different data-science approaches to change management can be used.\n","\n","![](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/jumpstart/jumpstart-fm-rag.jpg)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"iwhH0I3_r6pF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We will work in 5 steps:\n","\n","* Step 1: Obtain the document from the webpage using WebBaseLoader.

Tolkien set in Middle-earth. The book was first published on September 21, 1937 and is set in the years 2941\\xa0to\\xa02942 of the Third Age before the events of The Lord of the Rings.[1] Initially intended as a standalone story for children, it was later realigned more into the Middle-earth legendarium by 1951, when a revised edition was released.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Background\\n2 Story\\n3 Chapters\\n4 Development & influences\\n\\n4.1 Original version\\n4.2 Similarities to Beowulf\\n\\n\\n5 Editions\\n6 Appearances and mentions\\n7 In adaptations\\n\\n7.1 Films\\n\\n7.1.1 Rankin/Bass\\n7.1.2 Peter Jackson\\'s trilogy\\n\\n\\n7.2 Radio\\n7.3 Music\\n7.4 Games\\n\\n\\n8 Gallery\\n9 See also\\n10 References\\n11 External links\\n\\n\\nBackground\\nJ.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit (as well as the first two books of The Lord of the Rings) during his time as a Fellow and Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College of the University of Oxford in England.[2] Tolkien recollected in a 1955 letter to W.H. Auden[3] that The Hobbit began in the late 1920s when he was marking School Certificate papers and wrote the words \"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit\" on the back of one of them. The Hobbit didn\\'t go any further than that at the time, although in the following years he drew up Thrór\\'s Map, outlining the geography of the tale. The story itself he wrote in the early 1930s, and it was eventually published because he lent it to the Rev. Mother of Cherwell Edge when she was sick with the flu, and while she had the manuscript it was seen by a former student who was employed in the office of Allen & Unwin, a British publishing house.\\nTolkien introduced or mentioned characters and places that figured prominently in his legendarium, specifically Elrond and Gondolin, along with elements from Germanic legend. But the decision that the events of  The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings could belong to the same universe as The Silmarillion was made only after his initial success and the request by his publisher for a sequel.\\n\\nAlthough a fairy tale, the book is both complex and sophisticated: it contains many names and words derived from Norse mythology, and central plot elements from the Beowulf epic, it makes use of Anglo-Saxon runes, information on calendars and moon phases, and detailed geographical descriptions that fit well with the accompanying maps.     Dust cover of the first edition, illustrated by Tolkien himself  \\nStory\\n     Gandalf approaching Bag End, from an illustration by David T. Wenzel  \\nBilbo Baggins, a hobbit, smokes in his porch-way at Bag End one day, when Gandalf the wizard visits him. After a lengthy discussion in which Bilbo says \"good morning\" several times, Bilbo becomes flustered. He invites Gandalf to tea, and goes back inside his Hobbit-hole with a final \"good morning\".\\xa0 Gandalf\\xa0stays outside, and before leaving, carves a secret mark on Bilbo\\'s front door that indiciates: \"Burglar wants a good job, plenty of excitement and reasonable reward.\" Soon afterward, thirteen Dwarves (Thorin II Oakenshield, Glóin, Óin, Ori, Nori, Dori, Dwalin, Balin, Fíli and Kíli, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur) arrive at Bag End and begin discussing their planned treasure hunt while the hapless Bilbo provides obligatory hospitality. After the Dwarves and Bilbo\\xa0clean up the mess of their hefty supper, a map is produced and Gandalf arranges for Bilbo to take the job of burglar. The company\\'s quest is to use a secret door to enter the Lonely Mountain, send forth their burglar to\\xa0steal as much of the riches within its halls as possible, and do reconnaissance, then, to slay the dragon Smaug who had claimed the Mountains, and become rich again.\\nThe next morning, after oversleeping and nearly missing the start of the journey, Bilbo goes off with the Dwarves.\\xa0They are nearly eaten by 3 trolls, Tom, Bert, and William, but Gandalf manages to deceive the trolls into staying up all night whereupon they are turned into stone by the first light of dawn and die (the stone trolls appear later in The Fellowship of the Ring). In the Trolls\\' lair they find the trolls\\' storage of supplies, including several weapons. Bilbo acquires an Elvish short sword which he will later name\\xa0Sting, which glows blue in the presence of Orcs. Thorin acquires Orcrist, and Gandalf acquires Glamdring.\\nThe party travels to Rivendell, where they enjoy the hospitality of Elves. There, Elrond finds Moon-letters on the company\\'s map of the mountain, giving information about a secret door on its side.\\xa0They then proceed eastward toward the Misty Mountains.\\xa0There they are captured by goblins, and carried to Goblin-town. They run away, and during the escape Bilbo loses the Dwarves. Alone in the dark after running away from the goblins, Bilbo finds a gold ring on the floor of a cave passage and puts it in his pocket. Little did he know that this was the One Ring lost by Sauron centuries ago.\\nContinuing down a tunnel, he finds himself at the shore of an underground lake. Gollum quietly paddles up in his boat, and the two enact the riddle-game, under the condition that if Bilbo wins, Gollum will show him the way out, but if Bilbo loses, Gollum will eat him. After several riddles, which each manages to answer, Bilbo, whilst fiddling in his pocket unable to think of a riddle, asks himself aloud \"What have I got in my pocket?\". Gollum thinks this is supposed to be the next riddle, and as it doesn\\'t comply with the rules of the riddle-game, demands three guesses; in the end he fails to guess the answer. Bilbo demands his reward, but Gollum refuses and paddles off in his boat to an island in the lake, upon which he lives. After searching around for a while asking aloud \"Where is it?\\xa0Where\\'s my precious!?\"\\xa0to which Bilbo replies, \"I don\\'t know and I don\\'t care.\\xa0I just want to get out of here\", Gollum becomes suspicious, gets in his boat, and starts paddling back across the lake towards Bilbo.\\xa0Bilbo realizes his life is in danger and makes his escape down the maze of pitch-black tunnels, and Gollum gives chase. Bilbo trips, and finds the ring on his finger.\\xa0 Realizing he has no chance to escape his pursuer, he stays where he is and prepares to meet his fate, but Gollum runs right over him. Bilbo realizes the Ring, while on his finger, makes him invisible.\\xa0He manages to escape past Gollum, who has gone to guard the only exit, and finds his way to the surface where he rejoins the Dwarves.\\nDescending from the Misty Mountains, they survive an encounter with Wargs\\xa0(large evil wolves) and goblins by climbing trees. Eagles, summoned by Gandalf,\\xa0then came to rescue them.\\xa0 They soon meet Beorn, a man who can transform into a bear.\\xa0 They depart, having rested for several days. Gandalf leaves soon on an errand. The party traverses the great forest, Mirkwood, eventually running out of supplies.\\xa0Gandalf had warned them not to leave the Elf-path, but they saw fire and heard singing, so, hopeless, they leave the path to beg food from Wood-elves, only to get lost. They are captured by giant spiders, but Bilbo rescues the Dwarves by becoming invisible via the Ring and killing many spiders with Sting and rocks.\\xa0Elves then capture the Dwarves and imprison them, but Bilbo manages to sneak into the Elvenking Thranduil\\'s palace unnoticed using the Ring; he then helps the Dwarves escape in barrels floating down the river.\\nAfter staying for a short period of time at Lake-town, the treasure-seekers proceed to the Lonely Mountain.\\xa0Finding themselves unable to locate the secret door, the company sits down,\\xa0depressed, on a cliff.\\xa0Hearing a Thrush knocking on a stone, Bilbo looks up just in time to see the last rays of the Sun of Durin\\'s Day, shining on the cliff wall, to magically reveal the secret door (as was foretold by moon-letters upon a map that the company was in possession of).\\xa0Bilbo is sent down to\\xa0meet Smaug, the dragon, who realized the Company received help from the people of Lake-town, and sets out to destroy it. However, the Thrush that had been knocking on the stone was no ordinary bird but of an ancient race with whom the Men of Dale could communicate, and it had heard Bilbo\\'s report to the Dwarves; that Smaug had a bare patch in his armor on the left side of his chest (nearest his heart) that could be used to slaughter him, if only you could get close enough. It conveyed this message to one Bard the Bowman, who seeing the bare patch on the chest of Smaug, dispatched the dragon with a single black arrow, thus allowing the party of Dwarves to take possession of the treasure.\\nThe citizens of Lake-town arrive to make historical claims and demand compensation for the help they had rendered, as well as reparations for damage Smaug inflicted during his attack. They\\'re joined by the Elves, who also demand a share based on historical claims. The Dwarves refuse all negotiations and in turn summon kin from the mountains to strengthen their position. Seeing no other way to avert a war, Bilbo uses the Ring to steal the prized Arkenstone of Thráin from the Dwarves, which he uses to broker peace. However, after revealing this to Thorin, the latter becomes furious and kicks him out. Bilbo then leaves and joins the recently returned Gandalf and Lake-Town citizens. \\nJust as a grudging truce is agreed to, the three armies at the Lonely Mountain (Elves, Men, and Dwarves) are attacked by Goblins and Wargs from the Misty Mountains. A bitter battle ensues (named the Battle of Five Armies). Though suffering heavy losses, Elves, Men, and Dwarves prevail with the help of the Eagles. Thorin, Fili and Kili are unfortunately killed in the battle, but just before he dies, Thorin makes peace with Bilbo. The treasure is apportioned. Bilbo refuses most of the riches, realizing he has no way to bring them back home; he nevertheless takes enough with him to make himself a wealthy hobbit and live happily thereafter, unaware of the dangerous nature of his Ring, which he places in a glass case on his mantle. Gandalf and Balin later visit Bilbo at Bag-End.\\n\\nChapters\\nPrefatory note\\nAn Unexpected Party\\nRoast Mutton\\nA Short Rest\\nOver Hill and Under Hill\\nRiddles in the Dark\\nOut of the Frying-Pan into the Fire\\nQueer Lodgings\\nFlies and Spiders\\nBarrels Out of Bond\\nA Warm Welcome\\nOn the Doorstep\\nInside Information\\nNot at Home\\nFire and Water\\nThe Gathering of the Clouds\\nA Thief in the Night\\nThe Clouds Burst\\nThe Return Journey\\nThe Last Stage\\nDevelopment & influences\\nOriginal version\\nIn the initial edition of the novel, Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle game. During the writing of The Lord of the Rings Tolkien saw the need to revise this passage, in order to reflect the concept of the One Ring and its powerful hold on Gollum. Tolkien tried many different passages in the chapter that would become chapter two of The Lord of the Rings, \"The Shadow of the Past\". Eventually, Tolkien decided a rewrite of  was in order, and he sent a sample chapter of this rewrite (\"Riddles In The Dark\") to his publishers. Initially he heard nothing further, but when he was sent galley proofs of a new edition he learned to his surprise the new chapter had been incorporated as the result of a misunderstanding.\\nTolkien explained the two different versions in the introduction of The Lord of the Rings, as well as inside \"The Shadow of the Past\", as a \"lie\" that Bilbo made up, probably because of the One Ring\\'s influence on him, and which he originally wrote down in his book. Inside The Lord of the Rings, Bilbo finally confesses the real story at the Council of Elrond, although Gandalf had deduced the truth earlier. As Tolkien presented himself as the translator of the supposedly historic Red Book of Westmarch, where Bilbo and Frodo\\'s stories were recorded, he further explained the two differing stories in The Hobbit by stating he had originally used Bilbo\\'s original story, but later re-translated the work with the \"true story\" recorded by Frodo.\\nThis first edition also mentions \"gnomes\", an earlier word Tolkien used to refer to the second kindred of the High Elves — the Ñoldor (or \"Deep Elves\"). Tolkien thought that \"gnome\", being derived from the Greek gnosis (knowledge), was a good name for the Ñoldor he created to be the wisest of the other Elves. However, because of its English connotations of a small, secretive, and unattractive creature (see garden gnome), Tolkien removed it from later editions. He made other minor changes in order to conform the narrative to events in The Lord of the Rings and in the ideas he was developing for the Quenta Silmarillion.\\nSome facets of the story are incongruent with the fantasy setting of The Lord of the Rings, and can seem anachronistic:\\n\\nThe Trolls have English first and last names.\\nThere are uses of traditional \"magic\": when Bilbo tries to steal a purse from the Trolls, the purse shouts.\\nElves appear as either comical mischiefs (in Rivendell) or as chiefly hostile (in Mirkwood).\\nGandalf refers to Radagast as \"his cousin\" despite that Maiar are not said to have been familial.\\nThe Orcs pictured in The Hobbit seem allied neither to the Necromancer (Sauron) nor to Saruman, and instead have a simple hostility towards all Free Peoples.\\nReferences to \"fairies\" and \"ogres\" are included.\\nLanguage used in the text concerning the Ring reflected Bilbo\\'s lack of knowledge about it, as he was meant to be the author of the story.\\nSimilarities to Beowulf\\nDuring his time as a professor at the University of Oxford Tolkien studied Anglo-Saxon. One of the Anglo-Saxon pieces of literature he studied is the epic poem Beowulf, about which he wrote essays such as The Monsters and the Critics. Interesting parallels can be found between The Hobbit and Beowulf.\\nThe plots of the two stories are very similar. In both of them a party of 13 sets out to seek satisfaction for a crime committed by a dragon. Both parties contain a thief, which in The Hobbit is Bilbo, who steals a cup from the sleeping dragon\\'s hoard by using a secret passage. Both dragons then awake from their deep slumber and cause terror and destruction. Both dragons are well protected by their armour, a natural one in Beowulf and one made of gold and diamonds in The Hobbit, but finally they are killed. Both stories end or almost end with a fight with a dragon.\\nBut not only the plots share similarities: both main characters, Bilbo and Beowulf, share characteristics. Both heroes defy their enemies with their supernatural power, which in Bilbo\\'s case is the Ring and in Beowulf\\'s case is his supernatural strength. While Beowulf has the help of God, Bilbo often prevails because of his sheer luck. Both are of noble ancestry and both get separated from their group, Bilbo in the mountains, Beowulf when he travels down to the lair of Grendel\\'s mother in order to kill her.\\nAdditionally some elements of Anglo-Saxon culture can be found. In both books a king, which in Anglo-Saxon sometimes is called ring or gold giver, awards his warriors with treasures and war gear. In Anglo-Saxon culture poems are important, as they contain the people\\'s history and they are sung by scops. Two of these songs are found in Beowulf and more in The Hobbit. The Anglo-Saxon society was one of warriors and Tolkien\\'s Dwarves are close to this culture. They are warriors and like Anglo-Saxons they value jewellery and war gear.\\n\\nEditions\\n     One of the many covers of The Hobbit  \\nGeorge Allen & Unwin, Ltd. of London published the first edition of The Hobbit in September 1937. It was illustrated with many black-and-white drawings by Tolkien himself. The original illustrations would be colour plates. Allen & Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing, released at the end of 1937. Despite the book\\'s popularity, wartime conditions forced the London publisher to print small runs of the remaining two printings of the first edition.\\nAs remarked above, Tolkien substantially revised the text describing Bilbo\\'s dealings with Gollum in order to blend the story better into what The Lord of the Rings had become. This revision became the second edition, published in 1951 in both UK and American editions. Slight corrections to the text have appeared in the third (1966) and fourth editions (1978).\\nNew English-language editions of The Hobbit spring up often, despite the book\\'s age, with at least fifty editions having been published to date. Each comes from a different publisher or bears distinctive cover art, internal art, or substantial changes in format. The text of each generally adheres to the Allen & Unwin edition extant at the time it is published.\\nThe remarkable and enduring popularity of The Hobbit expresses itself in the collectors\\' market. The first printing of the first English language edition rarely sells for under U.S. $10,000 in any whole condition, and clean copies in original dust jackets signed by the author are routinely advertised for over $100,000.\\nIn 2001, Del Rey published an illustrated, abridged edition of the book, made by Charles Dixon and illustrated by David T. Wenzel.\\nThe Hobbit has been translated into many languages. Known translations, with the first date of publishing, are:\\n\\n\\n\\nLanguage\\n\\nYear\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nTranslator\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n\\nAlbanian\\n\\n2005\\n\\nHobiti\\n\\nMaklen Misha\\n\\nTirana: Shtëpia e Librit & Komunikit ISBN 99943-641-8-9\\n\\n\\nArabic\\n\\n2008\\n\\nالهوبيت، أو ذهابًا وعودة(Al-Hūbīt, aw Zehaban wa ʿAwda)\\n\\nهشام فهمي - مي غنيم (Hisham Fahmy - May Ghanim)\\n\\nDokki, Giza: Dar Lila (No ISBN)\\n\\n\\nArmenian\\n\\n1984\\n\\nՀՈԲԻՏ կամ գնալն ու գալը\\n\\nEmma Makarian\\n\\nYerevan.

The film was made by Rankin/Bass Productions and managed to economically retell most of the story within its 78-minute duration. An LP with the soundtrack and dialogue from the film was also released in 1977 by Disney through its Buena Vista Records label and an edited version, along with accompanying \"storyteller read-alongs,\" was later issued for the Mouse Factory\\'s Disneyland Records imprint. Harry N. Abrams published a large coffee-table illustrated edition of the book featuring concept art and stills. A second album by Glenn Robertson Yarbrough of music \"inspired\" by The Hobbit was also released.\\nThe film was first broadcast on NBC in the United States, on November 27, 1977 (on Sunday night, three days after Thanksgiving) and is presented in a heart-warming style, featuring a lot of songs (many of which are based on poems and lyrics from the book). Much of the story has been simplified and several episodes and key scenes are omitted.     \\n\\nPeter Jackson\\'s trilogy\\nMain article: The Hobbit film trilogy\\n     Teaser poster for An Unexpected Journey  \\nA live-action three-part movie adaption of The Hobbit, directed by Peter Jackson, was released in 2012, 2013 and 2014.[4] The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey on December 14, 2012, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug on December 13, 2013[5] and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies on December 17, 2014.\\n\\nRadio\\nThe Hobbit has been adapted for other media. BBC Radio 4 broadcast The Hobbit radio drama, adapted by Michael Kilgarriff, in eight parts (4 hours) from September to November 1968, which starred Anthony Jackson as narrator, Paul Daneman as Bilbo, and Heron Carvic as Gandalf. Another famous audio adaptation authorized by Professor Tolkien was published by Conifer Records in 1974 and featured Nicol Williamson as every character.\\n\\nMusic\\nMiddle-earth has been featured in songs notably by Enya and the Brobdingnagian Bards. Led Zeppelin\\'s songs \"Misty Mountain Hop\" and \"Ramble On\" both contain references to Tolkien\\'s mystical world. For The Hobbit itself, \"The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins\", performed by Leonard Nimoy as part of his 1968 Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy album, is the most pertinent because it recounts the book\\'s storyline in its two minutes. The ballad\\'s music video became a minor Internet meme in the early 2000s when The Lord of the Rings movies were released. \\n\\nGames\\nSeveral computer and video games, both official and unofficial, have been based on the book. One of the first was The Hobbit, a computer game developed in 1982 by Beam Software and published by Melbourne House for most computers available at the time, from the more popular computers such as the ZX Spectrum, and the Commodore 64, through to such esoteric computers as the Dragon 32 and Oric computers. By arrangement with the book publishers, a copy of the book was included with each game sold. \\nVivendi Universal Games published The Hobbit in 2003 for Windows PCs, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube. It is a \"hack and slash\" game produced as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings video games, but also as a softer version of those two games: less brutal, fewer enemies, but with an important platform aspect, the game was designed for smaller children. A similar version of this game was also published for the Game Boy Advance.\\n\\nGallery\\nOriginal coverCover of the first Houghton Mifflin publication, 1997The Hobbit 75th Anniversary Edition2003 edition cover\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis page uses content from Wikipedia.
