### [Project 1: Heart Disease prediction](https://github.com/luizguilhermedev/myportfolio/tree/main/h-disease-project))
A machine learning model designed to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not.

### [Project 2: Bulldozer price prediction](https://github.com/luizguilhermedev/myportfolio/tree/main/price-prediction-project))
A study to train a machine learning model to predict bulldozer's price

### [Projetct 3: Dog breed identifier]

### [Project 4: Lunar Lander](https://github.com/luizguilhermedev/myportfolio/tree/main/lunar-lander))
An awesome project from HuggingFace Deep RL, where we've used Deep RL algorithms to make an Agent(AI) learn how to land a Lunar lander in this classic game.
