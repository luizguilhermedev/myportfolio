**RAG for LLM Fine-tuning with LangChain and GEMMA Models**
This project explores the potential of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on specific tasks and contexts. We demonstrate this by implementing RAG with LangChain and GEMMA models.

**Project Goals:**

Showcase the capabilities of RAG architecture in enhancing LLM performance for targeted tasks and contexts using LangChain and GEMMA.
Investigate how RAG can leverage LangChain's functionalities for efficient retrieval and integration with GEMMA models.
Technical Approach:

**This project implements RAG with the following components:**

LangChain: A framework for building neural retrieval pipelines. It will be used to identify relevant documents for the specific task and context.
GEMMA Models: We will utilize the GEMMA 2B LLM for text generation tasks.
RAG Architecture:
Retrieval: LangChain will retrieve documents relevant to the given task and context.
Augmentation: The retrieved documents will be used to enrich the context provided to the GEMMA model.
Generation: The GEMMA model, equipped with the augmented context, will generate the desired output.
Expected Outcomes:

By implementing RAG with LangChain and GEMMA, we expect to achieve:

Improved accuracy of GEMMA on specific tasks through fine-tuning with relevant information retrieval.
Enhanced relevance of generated text by incorporating contextual information from retrieved documents.
Demonstration of LangChain's effectiveness in facilitating the RAG workflow with GEMMA models.
Getting Started:


Further Developments:

This project serves as a foundation for exploring RAG's potential with LLMs. Future work may involve:

Evaluating the performance of RAG on various tasks and contexts.
Experimenting with different retrieval strategies within LangChain.
Investigating the impact of different GEMMA model sizes on RAG's effectiveness.
