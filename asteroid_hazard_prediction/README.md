**Asteroid Hazard Classification**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model using XGBoost to classify asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous based on data from NASA. The model will learn from a dataset containing features that describe various physical and orbital properties of asteroids.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization:

A significant focus of this project will be on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization. By thoroughly examining the data, we can gain valuable insights and identify potential patterns before building the model. Here's what we will achieve through EDA and visualization:

Data Understanding: We will explore the dataset to understand the features, their data types, missing values (if any), and basic descriptive statistics.

Data Cleaning: If necessary, we will address any data cleaning steps like handling missing values or outliers.

Data Preprocessing:

Preprocess the data for model training. This may involve:

Handling missing values through imputation or removal.
Feature scaling for numerical features (e.g., standardization or normalization).
One-hot encoding for categorical features (same code as before).
Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).
Feature Relationships: We will plot a correlation matrix. This can reveal potential correlations or trends that might influence model performance.

Class Distribution: We will visualize the class distribution (Hazardous or not Hazardous) to understand the balance between the classes. This helps assess if the model needs any adjustments for imbalanced data.

Model Building and Evaluation:

After a comprehensive EDA, we will proceed with building a XGBoost model, Here's the workflow:

Model Creation: We will use XGBClassifier model

Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets.

Model Training and Evaluation: Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the unseen testing set using metrics like accuracy, ROC Curve and confusion matrix.

Expected Outcome:

Through this project, we expect to:

Develop a robust XGBoost model that can accurately classify asteroids as Hazardous or not hazardous.
Gain valuable insights into the mushroom dataset through extensive EDA and visualization techniques.
This project will serve as a valuable learning experience in applying machine learning for classification problems, emphasizing the importance of data exploration and visualization before model building.
