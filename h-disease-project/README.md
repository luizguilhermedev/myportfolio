Heart Disease Prediction with Random Forest Classifier
This project investigates the use of a Random Forest Classifier for predicting heart disease in patients based on their medical reports.

Project Goals:

Develop a classification model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients.
Utilize Random Forest Classifier for robust and interpretable predictions.
Employ Pandas and Matplotlib for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data characteristics.
Leverage scikit-learn for data preprocessing, splitting, and model training/evaluation.
Technical Approach:

Data Acquisition: From Kaggle dataset
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data using Pandas for missing values, outliers, and feature engineering (if necessary).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilize Matplotlib to visualize data distributions, relationships between features, and potential patterns related to heart disease.
Feature Engineering (Optional): Based on EDA insights, create new features that might be relevant for prediction.
Model Training & Evaluation:
Split the data into training, validation, and test sets using scikit-learn.
Train the Random Forest Classifier model on the training data.
Evaluate model performance on the validation set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Fine-tune hyperparameters of the model using validation set performance as a guide.
Testing & Reporting: Evaluate the final model performance on the unseen test set and report the results.
Expected Outcomes:

A trained Random Forest Classifier model capable of predicting heart disease in new patients.
Insights gained from EDA on the factors associated with heart disease.
Evaluation metrics showcasing the model's accuracy and effectiveness in predicting heart disease.
